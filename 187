I lay on my side on the ground and looked at the ceiling. I was in a hospital, but I couldn’t remember why. I could feel the IV line in my arm, but I couldn’t remember how I got there. I had been on a trip with my mom to see my grandmother, but I couldn’t remember why I was in the hospital. My head was spinning. I could see my mother crying in the corner. I tried to talk to her, but I couldn’t remember how to say anything. I could hear the doctors talking, but I couldn’t remember what they were saying. Then I remembered the feeling. I had been standing in the kitchen of my grandmother’s house. It was the first time I had been there in over a year. I could remember the way the linoleum felt under my feet, and I could remember the smell of the detergent that was used to wash the dishes. I could remember the sound of the window over the sink as it closed and the feeling of the hot water that came out of the faucet. I could remember the refrigerator. I could remember opening it. I could remember the feeling of the door hitting the top of my head. I could remember the pain. I could remember the doctor telling my mother and grandmother that I was going to be fine. I could remember my mother’s tears. I could remember my grandmother holding my hand and saying that everything was going to be okay. I could remember them saying that I had fallen and hit my head. I could remember them saying that I had hit my head pretty hard. I could remember them saying that I had been unconscious for three days. I could remember them saying that I had a concussion. I could remember them saying that I had a brain injury. I could remember them saying that I was lucky to be alive. I could remember them saying that I was lucky to be alive
