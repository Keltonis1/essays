I felt as if I were in a daze, as if frozen in time. I was only four years old when my parents informed me that my grandma had died. I kept staring at my parents, trying to figure out what it all meant. I knew that death was inevitable, but I was still too young to comprehend what it meant.

I remember thinking that, if I just tried hard enough, I could make her come back. I remember seeing her in the casket, thinking that she must be asleep, because she looked so peaceful. I remember thinking that she would be fine if she just woke up. I remember thinking that everything would be fine if she just woke up. I remember thinking that I would be fine if she just woke up. But she didn’t. I remember holding her cold hand, trying to give her a hug. I remember thinking that she was cold because she was sleeping. I remember crying so hard and not knowing how to stop. I remember thinking that I just needed my grandma back. I remember thinking that I had to make her wake up. I remember thinking that I had to help her
