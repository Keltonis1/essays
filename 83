She is a pioneer in a field in which no one had previously dared to tread. In a world that is still dominated by men, Dr. Joanna Bryson is a true trailblazer. She has made significant contributions to the field of computer science, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence. It is said that the true test of an intelligent mind is its ability to understand complex concepts. Her mind is certainly one of the most intelligent minds I have ever encountered. But her intelligence does not merely extend to her intellect. Her understanding of the human mind and the complexity of the human condition is what truly makes her brilliant. She is able to look at life from a perspective that I can only describe as beyond human. As I was walking through the rows of cubicles in my high school’s computer lab, I heard someone call out my name. I turned around and saw my friend sitting on the floor with a laptop in his hands. I was amazed at the time because he was able to take apart and put together a laptop with such ease. I was even more amazed when I learned that he had built the laptop himself. My friend introduced me to his computer teacher, Dr. Bryson. She greeted me with a smile and her hand. As I shook her hand, I was surprised at how soft her hands were. I was not expecting someone with her intelligence to have such delicate hands. She told me that she was not a typical computer science teacher. She taught me that her research was in the field of artificial intelligence and that her work focused on the theory of how to make computers think. Her words were not at all what I was expecting. My image of a computer scientist was someone like my friend, someone who was able to build a computer from scratch. I always imagined that someone who worked in artificial intelligence would be more like the professor in “The Terminator” who had an immense knowledge of computers and who was able to build machines to do his bidding
