"I hit the ground, and I was bleeding," said Mr. Kim, 40, a professor of English at Dongguk University in Seoul. "I was scared. I thought, 'This is it. I'm going to die.' I was sure I was going to die." He had almost been killed by a taxi, which veered off the road, jumped a sidewalk and plowed into him. It had been raining heavily that day, and the driver had been speeding, Mr. Kim said.
Mr. Kim, who had moved to New York to teach at the City University of New York after receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, returned to South Korea to teach. He said he had been living there for about four years when he was struck by the taxi as he walked to a bus stop.
The accident left him with a few scars on his forehead, but Mr. Kim said his painful experiences didn't end there. He said he had been followed by the driver, who would come to the university at night and glare at him.
"I'm scared every time I see him," he said. He said he did not know if the driver was mentally ill or if he had been given a suspended sentence. "I feel so much anger," he said. "I feel so powerless."
Mr. Kim said he had been living with the trauma for more than a year and had been seeing a therapist, but he had not yet told anyone at the university about it.
Mr. Kim said he had thought about returning to the United States, but he said he worried that the driver would follow him there. "I'm still scared," he said. "I'm still scared."
