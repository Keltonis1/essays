In the darkness of the movie theater, I stared at the screen and felt an overwhelming sense of dread. The film was a horror movie, and I had never been a fan of these types of films. However, I was here with my best friend and we had promised to see it together. In the dim light, the flickering images of the movie provided a surreal setting to the real-life terror unfolding before me. For the next two hours, my friend shrieked, screamed, and trembled. Her uncontrollable reactions to the movie seemed completely out of place. I felt sorry for her, but at the same time, I could not understand why she was reacting this way. After the movie, I asked her if she was all right. She said that she was fine, but that the movie had been terrifying. Her reactions to the movie were even more bizarre than the film itself. I was completely perplexed. It was then that I learned about the condition called synesthesia. My friend has a condition in which she is able to taste colors and see sounds. Because of this, she had experienced the film as if she were actually there. As the movie progressed, she could taste the fear and hear the screams. I had never known that someone could have such an experience. The condition was completely foreign to me, but it had opened my eyes to a whole new world. I began to research synesthesia. I learned that it is a rare condition in which one sense is cross-wired with another. People with synesthesia experience the world differently than the rest of us. They see sounds and taste colors. However, this is not just an experience. It is also a gift. For some, synesthesia can be an artistic inspiration. Artists have been able to see their paintings in color and have even been able to “taste” the music they hear. One synesthete said that she can only write when she tastes the flavor of the words
