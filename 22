My dad always told me, “Study hard, and one day you’ll have a good job.” I was the smartest student in my elementary school, always taking home the gold medal in every subject. I never wanted to disappoint my dad. So I studied. And studied. And studied. And I got really good grades. My dad was so proud of me. I was proud of myself too. I’m the first one in my family to go to college. I’m the first one in my family to get a master’s degree. And I’m the first one in my family to get a PhD. My dad was really happy for me. But my dad didn’t come to my graduation. I didn’t want to disappoint him, so I didn’t tell him about it. I didn’t want to disappoint him, so I didn’t visit him when he was sick. I didn’t want to disappoint him, so I didn’t tell him that I was pregnant. I didn’t want to disappoint him, so I kept working, studying, writing papers, and going to conferences. I didn’t want to disappoint him, so I kept pushing myself. And pushing myself. And pushing myself. And I got really sick. I thought I was having a heart attack, but I was really having a stroke. I had to quit my job, and I lost my scholarship. My husband left me. And my dad didn’t come to my funeral. I never saw my dad again. I was too busy being the best.
