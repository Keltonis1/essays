"The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs When I was five years old, I asked my dad for a bicycle. I loved how fast I could go and how easy it was to ride. But he said I was too young to have one. Instead, he got me a wooden wagon that I could ride around the block. It was not nearly as fun as a bike, but I still loved it. I didn't know it then, but my dad knew what he was doing. A few months later, I had learned how to ride the wagon on my own and was using it to carry things. Then one day, I saw my dad's bike leaning against the wall in the garage. He had forgotten to put it away after riding it. I hopped on and started to pedal around the house. I had been riding a wagon for a few months, but this was different. It felt so much faster. I loved it! I didn't want to stop, but I did. I had to. I was afraid of crashing into something. I didn't want to get hurt. That was the last time I rode a bike until the summer before fifth grade. I had been begging my dad for a bike for a while. He told me I was too young to have one. So, I did what I did when I wanted something. I kept asking and asking. I even tried to make him feel bad. I kept reminding him that he said I was too young. Finally, he said yes. I couldn't believe it! I got the bike that I wanted! I was so happy. My bike came with training wheels, which I didn't want. But I didn't want to hurt my dad's feelings. I tried to ride the bike, but I was scared. I kept falling off and hurting myself. I didn't know what to do. My dad saw me fall and told me that it was OK.
