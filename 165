I wasn’t interested in medicine until my grandma was diagnosed with cancer. I was only ten years old at the time. My grandma treated us to a trip to the world-famous Disney World and Sea World whenever she visited us in Los Angeles. My favorite part was when she would wake me up in the middle of the night to take me to the kitchen to devour whatever she was making: sticky rice cakes, rice cakes with sweet beans, or puffed rice and seaweed. She was a phenomenal cook. When she arrived in Los Angeles and the doctor told us that she had lung cancer, I was stunned. I had no idea what cancer was. I couldn’t understand how a person could have cancer. I just knew that my grandma was going to die. During the following months, I realized how short life is and how precious each moment is. My grandma was always so busy. She would go to work, come home, cook dinner, and take care of us. She would even spend time teaching me how to cook Korean food. But when she had cancer, she started to slow down. The only thing she could do was sleep, and she didn’t have the energy to cook dinner for us. My grandma had always been such a resilient person. She never complained about anything. After her diagnosis, she never complained about how she was feeling. I had never seen her cry. When she was sick, she dealt with her illness by taking it day by day. She was always thinking about me and my brother. She made sure that we were going to be okay. After she died, I realized that she was so much more than just my grandma. She was my hero.
