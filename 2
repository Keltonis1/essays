The first time I went to a Korean restaurant was when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to a small city in New Jersey, and I was surprised to find out that there were so many different types of food that I had never heard of before. One of the dishes that my family ordered was called japchae. The waiter brought it out in a large plate with a big bowl of rice. The dish had thin, transparent noodles with carrots, cucumbers, and other vegetables. To my surprise, the noodles were translucent and very chewy. I found the dish delicious, and have been a fan of Korean food ever since. When I turned 16, my family and I moved back to New York. I had not seen my best friend in two years, so we were really excited to see each other. She and I decided to have lunch at a Korean restaurant near my house. We were greeted by a waiter who was very nice and smiled a lot. I ordered the same dish I had tried at the restaurant when I was 10. The waiter brought it out to the table, and I eagerly picked up my chopsticks. To my horror, the dish had become very salty. I had never had that problem with the food at that restaurant before. I had a strange feeling in my stomach, and I knew that I would not be able to eat the food. I told my friend that I wasnâ€™t hungry and we decided to go to a restaurant that we both knew would be good. After eating there, I was still feeling uneasy. I thought that maybe I was just feeling sick from the change in the weather. When I got home, I was surprised to see that my parents had ordered Korean food from the same restaurant that I had gone to. When I saw the box of japchae, I started to cry. The salty food was a reminder of my friend, who had moved away. I was homesick and missed my friend
