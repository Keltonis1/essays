My passion for science had always been ignited by the intricate details and interconnections underlying phenomena and phenomena. However, when I began my undergraduate studies in Chemistry, I was disappointed by the fact that my education was geared solely towards rote memorization. I craved for a hands-on, experimental approach to learning. During my junior year, I discovered Bioinformatics. Using computers to organize and analyze data, I saw it as a bridge between the world of pure science and applied science. The ability to analyze biological data seemed to be the practical, hands-on approach I was looking for. I saw it as the perfect marriage of the abstract and the concrete. This year, my plans have been focused on applications of Bioinformatics, ranging from the development of a novel algorithm to help the fight against cancer to the utilization of an existing algorithm to analyze a novel gene. My work in Bioinformatics has sparked my interest in the field of research. I now believe that the best way to learn is to experience the world through my own eyes. In the future, I hope to obtain a PhD in the field of Bioinformatics or Computational Biology and continue to explore the vast, uncharted territory of molecular biology. However, the most important thing is to stay awake. To stay awake, you have to be willing to be awake. To be willing to be awake, you have to be able to figure out what it is that would make you want to be awake. I was able to find that “something” through Bioinformatics. I now understand that I must maintain the same careful, inquisitive approach that led me to Bioinformatics and let it carry me through the rest of my life.
