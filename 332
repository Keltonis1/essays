When my grandfather was young, he used to carry heavy books on his back to and from school. These books were his only companions and they helped him learn English and French. In the library, he would choose the most interesting books and read them to learn new things. My grandfather’s desire to learn never ended. In addition to teaching himself how to play the piano, he taught himself how to drive a car, how to build a house, and how to design a beautiful garden. In his spare time, he would go to a computer lab and learn how to use the computer. At the age of 90, he was still learning new things and sharing his knowledge with others. As a child, I was inspired by my grandfather’s thirst for knowledge. I tried to be like him and to love learning as much as he did. When I was in elementary school, I enjoyed learning how to read and write in Chinese. In high school, I was thrilled to learn about algebra and trigonometry. Now, as a freshman at the University of California, Irvine, I am still learning about the human body and the laws of physics. I am inspired by my grandfather’s example and try to learn new things every day. I am glad to have the opportunity to be in this program because it gives me a chance to share my love for learning with others.
