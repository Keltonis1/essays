I'm not really sure what I expected when I decided to come to the cemetery. The reality of death has never bothered me, but it wasn't until recently that I became interested in what happens to our bodies after we die. I know what happens to our minds. The dying part was easy, but the dead part was hard. As a child, I thought the soul was trapped in the body and only escaped after the body had died. I remember one day, I went to my grandmother's house and she was very sick. She was coughing a lot, and I could tell that she was having a hard time breathing. My mother and my aunt were both there. My mother was holding my aunt's hand and crying. My aunt kept saying, "She's not going to make it." I was very scared and confused. I didn't understand why my grandmother was so sick. I was young, so I asked my mom, "Is grandma going to die?" She said, "Yes, she is going to die." My mother started to cry harder. I felt sad, but I didn't understand why my mother was so upset. I didn't understand what death was. I thought that my grandmother would wake up from a bad dream. I didn't know that death was the end. I was just a little boy, so I decided to play with my toys to take my mind off of my grandmother's sickness. My grandmother was always so kind and caring. She would always give me toys, and when I would come over, she would let me play with her stuff. I always looked forward to going over to her house. That day, I didn't want to play with my toys, but I didn't want to upset my mother, so I decided to play with my toys quietly. My grandmother was always very healthy. I didn't think that she would die. But I knew that she was very sick. She was very weak and had a hard time breathing
