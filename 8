The summer after my sophomore year of college, I went to South Korea for the first time. It was a chance to travel to a country that had always seemed so mysterious and foreign to me, and to see my family for the first time in over a year. My grandparents were a large part of my childhood. They are both in their seventies, and my grandma in particular was always the center of attention in my life. She would make the most delicious food for me, spoil me with toys, and give me the biggest bear hugs. I was always her favorite grandchild. She is a warm and loving person, and I think it’s impossible not to like her. The day before I left for Korea, I was on the phone with my grandma, and I said, “I’m going to miss you, grandma.” She replied, “Well, I’ll miss you too, but I’ll see you soon.” I was confused. “What do you mean?” I asked. “I thought you were going to Korea for a month.” “Oh,” she said. “I don’t know. I’m going to go live with your uncle.” I was so shocked that I was silent for a while. She said that she didn’t want to go live with my parents because she’d be taking care of my brother, who is six years younger than me. I knew that my grandma had always wanted to take care of a baby, and I was touched that she wanted to take care of my brother. I was also excited that she would get to live with my uncle, who is a very loving and caring person. I was going to miss her, but I was excited for her new adventure. My grandma has been living with my uncle for almost three years now. They are very happy together.
