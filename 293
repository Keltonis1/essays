I walked in the door of his apartment, and, as always, the room was dark, and the smell of cigarettes and old papers filled the air. The dust in the air was thick, as though the room didn’t see light in years, and the only light came from the computer screen. I sat down in my usual chair and watched as he typed away furiously, his face lit by the glow of the screen. He was always like this: sitting in the dark, smoking, and typing away, oblivious to the world. He was never one for small talk. When I called out to him, he would grunt in response. We had very little in common, but somehow, we were roommates. We had shared the same dorm room for the last three years, and now that we were seniors, we were moving in together. Finally, he was ready to move out of his parents’ house after years of refusing to leave. He was ready to start his life, and he would move across the country to start a new job. I would be alone in our apartment where we had spent countless hours in the dark. I had no idea how I would survive without him. My final year of college was the year I met him. I was a freshman who just barely managed to get a scholarship, and he was a senior who was just as poor as I was. We had almost nothing in common. He was a genius who, by his own admission, “spent all his time in the library.” I was the guy who partied and was never in class. He smoked copious amounts of weed, and I had not been in a classroom in years. He was a software engineer with a job lined up in Silicon Valley, and I was a philosophy major who spent most of my time at the library. I was a good-looking guy who was well-liked by everyone, and he was a skinny, geeky guy
