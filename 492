What’s the difference between good and evil? I’ve never been sure. When I was six years old, my mother was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. While I was too young to understand what that meant, I knew that she was sick. My father left her, and she had to quit her job to care for me. I remember the long nights when I would lie awake listening to her labored breathing. I would often wake up to find her sitting by the window, staring out at the night sky. We spent the last three years of her life living with my grandparents. While I had to leave my friends and the home I had known, I never lost my mother. But after she passed away, I found myself alone. I missed my mother, and I couldn’t help but feel guilty for having survived. I was angry at God for taking her away. I had spent years wishing I could have gone with her. When I was thirteen, I started to go to church, trying to find answers in the Bible. I would go to youth group every Wednesday, singing songs and learning how to become a good Christian. I remember hearing the pastor talk about the difference between good and evil. It was as if he were speaking to me. He told us that good people care about others, that they have compassion and are selfless. Evil people, he said, are selfish and only care about themselves. He talked about how evil people never change and never see the truth. I began to think about my mother. I remembered the nights when she would sit in front of the window. I remembered how she never went to church. I began to wonder if she had been evil. I began to wonder if I had been evil. I spent years wishing I could have gone with her. I spent years wishing I had been a better son. I spent years wishing I had been a better person. I spent years wishing I had died instead of her
