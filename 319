When I first learned of the word "senioritis", I thought it was just another made-up word, one that people used to describe the typical high school student who didn’t want to work hard in their last year of high school. I mean, I never really knew what it meant to have senioritis until I started to get closer to graduation. That’s when I realized that senioritis was a feeling that you can’t really describe. It’s that feeling when you’re in your last year of high school and you’re not really excited to go to school. It’s that feeling when you don’t want to get up in the morning. It’s that feeling when you’re dreading your next class. It’s that feeling when you’re having trouble staying awake during class. Senioritis is that feeling that you’re ready to graduate and start a new chapter in your life. When I was a freshman, I used to have so much enthusiasm about high school. I used to look forward to every class and every activity. I used to love going to school every morning and I used to be excited about everything that was going on in my life. But as I became a senior, I felt that my energy for high school was fading. I was ready to leave all my worries behind and just move on with my life. When I was a freshman, I didn’t want to be seen as a freshman. I wanted to be seen as a senior. I wanted to be taken seriously and to be recognized by my teachers and my peers. But now that I’m a senior, I feel that I’ve matured a lot over the years. I’m not the same person that I was in the beginning of high school. I’ve learned so much and I’ve grown to become a better person
