I was staring at the white walls, waiting for the doctor to come in. “Your grandfather has Hepatitis C,” he said. I was numb, trying to absorb the meaning of those words. I was only 12 years old. I couldn’t even pronounce the word “Hepatitis C.” I knew that it was a sickness and that it was serious. My grandfather was a liver doctor, a specialist who was supposed to be the best in the field. A year later, I watched my grandfather walk down the aisle at my wedding. He was a shadow of his former self, struggling to walk and smiling with a wan expression. I still remember the moment when he stumbled and my mother was forced to help him walk. I knew that my grandfather would not last much longer. In December of 2007, I visited my grandfather at his home in Seoul, South Korea. I sat with him in the living room, watching an American comedy show on television. He had gotten much weaker and could no longer work. I knew that the end was near. My grandfather was lying on a sofa, breathing with difficulty. I could only imagine the pain he must have been feeling. I sat there, holding his weak hands in mine, tears streaming down my face. I was once again a 12-year-old boy, staring at the white walls of a hospital room while waiting for a doctor to come in. My grandfather was not my only patient. That Christmas Eve, my grandfather took his last breath. I was still holding his hands. He was lying there, peaceful, in his slippers, with his hands still in mine. I closed his eyes and left.
