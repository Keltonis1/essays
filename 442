I have an older sister. She was always a straight-A student, and I was a C student. In elementary school, my sister would help me with my homework, and I would help her with her math homework. I always wanted to be just like my sister. When we got to middle school, we started taking different classes. We both wanted to be in AP classes. My sister took AP English, and I took AP Chemistry. My sister took honors classes, and I took regular classes. When we got to high school, my sister took AP classes and I took regular classes. My sister wanted to go to college, and I didn’t. When I was in middle school, I didn’t want to go to college. I wanted to go to community college because I didn’t want to be in debt. My sister was worried about me because she knew that my family was struggling. She told me that I could do anything I wanted to do, and that she wanted me to go to college. She said that I would be able to have a better life if I went to college. My sister said that she would pay for college, and that she would give me the money when I got accepted. I was happy when she told me that. I knew that she wanted the best for me. She said that she didn’t want me to have a life like hers. She wanted me to be happy. I was accepted into three colleges. I went to the college that I wanted to go to. I was happy because my sister was going to pay for college. I got a scholarship, and I was able to go to college. I graduated in May, and I will be getting my diploma soon. My sister paid for college, and she is still paying for my education. I am very thankful for what she has done for me. I would never have gone to college if it wasn’t for her. I will
