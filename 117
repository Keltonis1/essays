I got off the bus and walked up the hill. With each step, the gray, lifeless trees became more distinct. There was no snow on the ground, which was unusual for this time of year. I took a deep breath as the crisp air filled my lungs. It was a good day for a hike. After a few minutes, I reached the top of the hill. The trees were gone, and the rest of the scenery was taken over by a vast green pasture. I took a few steps onto the grass and dropped my backpack. I looked back at the road I had come from. It fell off the hill and disappeared into the woods. It was a good day for a hike. I took out my lunch and started to eat. My favorite sandwich was peanut butter and jelly. I also had two apples and two chocolate chip cookies. My favorite part of hiking was lunch. After I was done eating, I started walking through the grass. It was a little wet from the snow melting. I walked for a while and soon came to a dirt road. I turned to my left and started walking down the road. I had been walking for about ten minutes when I saw a car coming. I stepped off the road and onto the grass to let it pass. The car slowed down and stopped. It was a lady in a small car, and she looked to be about my grandma’s age. She rolled down the window and asked me if I could help her with something. I said sure and walked over. She said that she was looking for her dog. She said she was out here hiking and her dog ran off. I asked her what kind of dog it was. She said it was a beagle. I told her to wait, and I’d go look for it. I went back to my backpack and pulled out a piece of paper and a pen. I wrote “Lost Dog” on the paper and showed it to her.
