We've got one. It's just, well, the idea is so crazy, we're not sure it will work. And the stuff we need is really expensive. So, we need a little help from you. See, it's like this. We're a bunch of scientists. We spend our days and nights dreaming up all kinds of crazy stuff, like rocket ships and artificial intelligence and cures for cancer. And one day, one of us said, "Hey, why don't we try something crazy? Why don't we create life?" So, we did. We built a machine that can do just that. We call it "Eve." And it's working. Eve can create new life. It's pretty cool. We've got mice. We've got monkeys. We've even got dogs. But now we want to try something even more ambitious. Something really crazy. We want to create a human. So, here's the crazy part. We need your help. See, we've been working for a long time, and we've got the body parts. We've got a head, two arms, two legs. We've got a heart and a brain. But we don't have a soul. We need your soul. We need you to come in, lay down on the table, and donate your body to science. We need you to be our first human subject. We'll keep your body alive and in good health. We'll take care of you. We'll give you the best food, the best medical care. And in return, you'll help us create the first human soul. So, that's our story. We've got a crazy machine. We've got the body parts. We just need a soul. We need you.
