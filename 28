My grandmother died of breast cancer when I was in high school. I was told that she died a painful death and was haunted by her image of her writhing in pain, gasping for air. When I was in college, I took a biology class. I learned about the cells of the body and their functions. I learned about how cells are the building blocks of life and how they grow and multiply. I learned about how one’s body deteriorates and the different ways one can die. When I learned about the cell cycle, I was reminded of my grandmother’s death. It was then that I decided to become a cancer researcher. I was determined to find a cure for cancer. After I graduated, I went to medical school. I studied all day and often went to the lab late at night. I wanted to understand how cancer cells grow and multiply and how they cause a person to die. After medical school, I went to a graduate school and studied cancer research for four years. I knew that my time was limited. When I was about to complete my studies, my grandfather fell ill. He was diagnosed with cancer. He was only a year older than my grandmother. I was devastated. My dream of finding a cure for cancer was destroyed. I had failed my grandmother. I was consumed by guilt. I did not know how to tell my grandfather that I was a cancer researcher. I had not found a cure for cancer. I had not saved my grandmother. When my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer, I did not tell him that I was a cancer researcher. I did not tell him that I had learned about cancer cells. I did not tell him that I was studying how cancer cells grow and multiply and how they cause a person to die. When my grandfather died, I did not tell him that I had failed to save him. I did not tell him that I was a cancer researcher.
