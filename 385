A little over a year ago, my grandma passed away. It took me almost a month to realize I had lost her. I hadn’t been giving her much thought. I hadn’t seen her since I left for college. I had been busy with school, and so had she. But in the background of my mind, I was always waiting for the day to come when I could go home to see her again. I never thought that day would never come. On the last day I saw her, I was in my room, talking to my mom about an upcoming test while my grandma carefully sewed a button back onto my coat. She was always very careful with my coat. She would always sew on all the buttons and make sure that all the patches were in the right place. After she finished my coat, she would always smile. I used to believe that she liked my coat because it made me look handsome. But when I got older, I realized that she was sewing on the buttons because she was proud of me. I never told her that I knew, though. I didn’t want to make her feel bad. I didn’t want her to think that I knew I was the only one she was proud of. As I sit here thinking about what I remember of her, my mind keeps drifting back to that coat. I remember the way she would always smile, the way she would always take care of things. I remember the small things, the little things that made my grandma my grandma. I didn’t realize how much I missed her until I had lost her. But as I look back, I realize I was always a little bit in love with her. She was always gentle, always kind, and always the best grandma anyone could ever have. She was always my grandma, and it almost feels like she always will be.
