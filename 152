There are a million beautiful things to see in the world. But nothing, nothing is more beautiful than a smile. While my friends and I were taking pictures of the World Trade Center from the George Washington Bridge, my friend suggested we take a picture of each other smiling. I was hesitant at first, but then I smiled at the camera. That smile became a symbol of the good times I had with my friends. I was happy to have a friend like her, one who always wanted to take pictures of us. We had always been inseparable. In fact, she was the one who taught me how to take pictures. Every day, we would go to the nearby park and take pictures of the people there. We even took pictures of the man who was always shouting at himself. I was sure that he did not know that we were taking pictures of him. I guess that was our way of making a contribution to our school newspaper, though we were not writers. We were simply the photographers. We also went to the beach and the Statue of Liberty. She was my best friend. I knew practically everything about her. But even though I knew everything about her, I did not know that she had been diagnosed with bone cancer. She was always smiling, but she never told me that she was in pain. I knew that she was in pain, but I never asked her. It was a sunny and beautiful day. I was with my family at the beach when I saw a beautiful woman coming my way. She was always beautiful and elegant. She was wearing a black dress and was carrying a black bag. She was my friend. I was so happy that I ran towards her. But when I got close to her, I saw tears on her face. “Why are you crying?” I asked. “I can’t walk anymore.” “I am sorry.” I said. I had no idea what to say. “
