I have always been the first one up on a Saturday morning. I’m the one who presses the button to play my favorite song at 7:30 AM, and I’m the one who pours the cereal and milk in the bowl before anyone else. I’m the one who stands by the microwave and presses the timer to the minute when it’s time to take the warm oatmeal out of the microwave. I’m the one who runs down the stairs, trying not to fall as I rush to make it to the table in time to have my breakfast. But, I’m also the one who misses my mom every Saturday. I’m the one who always finds the breakfast table empty when I come down to the kitchen. I’m the one who sits by myself in the dining room, eating oatmeal alone. I’m the one who gets up and leaves the table to get a glass of water. I’m the one who stares at the glass of water, wishing my mom would come and put her hand on my shoulder. But, I’m also the one who sits by myself in the dining room, drinking water alone. I’m the one who turns on the TV, watching cartoons alone. I’m the one who calls my mom on the phone, but there’s no answer. I’m the one who cries when I hang up the phone. I’m the one who gets a tissue from the tissue box and wipes my tears away. I’m the one who sits by myself in the dining room, crying alone. I’m the one who walks to the kitchen to pour more water. I’m the one who turns off the TV, getting ready to go to school. I’m the one who takes the empty glass to the sink. I’m the one who walks out
