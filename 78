My grandmother was born into a world that valued the family name. My grandfather’s father was a prestigious scholar who authored books on Confucianism. Although my grandmother was a renowned artist and painter in her own right, her identity was overshadowed by my grandfather’s father’s reputation. To avoid being a burden on my grandfather’s father, my grandmother’s family moved to Japan to seek a better life. As a young adult, my grandmother married my grandfather and gave birth to my father. She always spoke of the love she had for my grandfather, a love that was not returned. My grandfather, a man who drank too much and beat my grandmother, married my grandmother only because of her beauty. However, the one thing that my grandfather never beat was my grandmother’s love for him. She remained by his side even as he gambled away his money and left her with nothing. Although my grandfather often insulted my grandmother, she would not utter a single word of retaliation. Her love was unconditional. Despite the hardship of being married to a man who was not a kind man, my grandmother had four children, including my father. My grandmother raised my father and his three brothers on her own as my grandfather was too preoccupied with his own problems. My grandmother taught my father the art of calligraphy and painted beautiful paintings of bamboo. Even as she grew older, my grandmother never forgot her love for art. Although her health began to decline, my grandmother never stopped painting. My grandmother’s love for art is one of the reasons why I became an artist. My grandmother taught me the importance of beauty and the importance of the family name. My grandfather never cared about his name or his legacy. He cared about his money and himself. But my grandmother cared about the beauty of her paintings and the importance of our family name. Although my grandmother’s paintings were not as valuable as my grandfather’s father
