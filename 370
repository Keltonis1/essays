I was in the shower when she called. “Is it true?” she asked in a small voice. I did not know what to say. “I don’t know,” I replied, “I’m going to find out.” Stepping out of the shower, I dried myself off and put on my clothes. I grabbed my keys and stepped outside, where I found my mother waiting for me in the dark. “Let’s just go to the hospital,” she said. I did not say anything in response. We both knew what awaited us. We drove in silence. When we arrived, I asked my mother to wait for me in the car. I wanted to be alone. As I walked through the double doors, I could not help but feel that I was not walking into a hospital, but a mausoleum. All the lights were off. The receptionist’s empty seat, the waiting room, the halls, the elevators, the walls, the doors—everything was silent, dark, lifeless. I walked into my sister’s hospital room. She was asleep. I called her name, but she did not respond. I walked over and sat down next to her. I held her hand. I thought to myself, “She is finally at peace.”
