“You are going to be a doctor someday,” my grandmother told me. “You must save lives.” These were the last words she spoke to me before she died. Since she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, she had been forgetting words, people, places, and ultimately, her own self. Each night before I fell asleep, I would lie in bed and think of different ways I could save her. I would read up on Alzheimer’s disease in medical journals and textbooks. I would study the brain in biology class. I would even watch the Discovery Channel and read medical journals. Yet no matter what I did, it seemed that my grandmother was going to leave me. The night before she died, I held her hand in mine and I could feel her pulse grow weaker and weaker. I could feel her slipping away from me. I could feel my heart breaking. I had never felt so helpless in my entire life. I wanted to do something, anything, to save her, but there was nothing I could do. She was gone. That was the day I decided that I would become a doctor. I would dedicate my life to finding a cure for Alzheimer’s disease. I would study every day to become the best doctor in the world. I will not give up until I find a way to save my grandmother.
