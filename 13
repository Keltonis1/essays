My dad taught me to dance when I was a child. I would sit on his knees and hold onto his arms as he swayed me back and forth. When I was a little older, I learned the cha-cha, waltz, and tango. My father’s dancing became my first lesson in movement and musicality. As a teen, I learned how to dance on my own. I would wear platform shoes and dance in front of my mirror. I loved how I looked when I danced. It was only a matter of time before I wanted to be on stage. I got my first job as a dancer at the local mall. I would dance in a crowd of cheerleaders and other dancers. I didn’t mind the crowd, but I hated the uniforms. They were all the same, and I hated looking like everyone else. I began to look for another job. I went to a local theater and asked if they needed a dancer. I was given a job on the spot. I had to wear a black leotard and tights. I was to dance in front of the main characters during their monologues. The dance was called a “mood dance” and was meant to portray the inner feelings of the characters. It was more challenging than being a cheerleader. The dance was usually taught to me on the spot, and I had to learn it and perform it on stage in front of an audience. It was a lot of pressure. But I learned how to perform under pressure. I learned how to focus on what was important and ignore what was not. When I was older, I went to the University of Michigan. I didn’t dance for two years. But I missed it. So I decided to take ballet classes to keep my skills up. I loved ballet. It was challenging and graceful. It was art. But it wasn’t enough. I was still drawn to the stage.
