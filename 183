As a child, I spent my days at the beach. My best friend was the ocean. It was never too hot or too cold. It was always just right. The water was a calming place. I was always at peace. I spent hours and hours there. When I was eight, my parents moved us from the beach to a small city. The city was crowded and busy. The water was dirty and gray. I had to share the water with people who didn’t respect it. My friends became other things that I liked to do. When I was eleven, my parents divorced. My mom moved me back to the beach. The water was still as clear and blue as ever. I felt like I had never left. I spent the summer there. I had fun, and I was always at peace. Then, it happened. I was twelve. It was summer. I was at the beach. It was a beautiful day. The water was warm. I was enjoying the sun. Then, I saw it. A shadow in the water. It was big. I didn’t think anything of it. It swam by me. It swam back. I could see its face. It was a shark. It was coming for me. It was going to eat me. I tried to scream, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t move. I just sat there, paralyzed, waiting to die. Then, I woke up. I was on the beach, still in the water. I was alive. The shark was gone. It was a dream. I was alive. I was twelve. I have a rare heart condition. I’m supposed to die at thirty. I’m fifteen now. I’m going to live to thirty. I’m going to swim with sharks. I’m going to do everything I want to do. I’m going to be happy.
