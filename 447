I have to admit that I am a very shy person. Growing up in a rural area, I spent most of my time in my room or reading. I had never had many friends and I was content with that. I felt safe in my room, away from the rest of the world. I was never one to talk much or make friends. When I was younger, I was always afraid of being judged by my peers and I would always end up in a corner alone. When I started middle school, I met some really nice people who were always nice to me. However, they didn’t seem to understand me. They were always talking about things that I didn’t know about. They talked about people I didn’t know and I couldn’t keep up with the conversation. I would sit in the corner and stare at the clock, just wanting to go home. I never really talked to them. I never really tried to fit in with them. I never tried to make any friends. In high school, I met a lot of new people and it seemed like I was starting over again. It was the same story as before. I always seemed to be the outsider. I was always the shy girl in the corner, who had a few friends, but never really fit in with the rest of the people. I never really talked to them. I never really tried to fit in with them. I never tried to make any friends. I never really talked to them. I never really tried to fit in with them. I never tried to make any friends. As I got older, I became more and more shy. I never really talked to anyone. I never really tried to fit in with them. I never tried to make any friends. I never really talked to them. I never really tried to fit in with them. I never tried to make any friends. I never really talked to them. I never really tried to fit in
