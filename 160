In a sea of cornstalks, a single leaf floated, the last remnant of the plant. The corn was picked clean, and this leaf was its final cry. In an instant, it was gone, crushed by the boot of a careless farmer. It was then that I knew: I must become a corn farmer. I needed to ensure that this didn’t happen again. I needed to create a place where every plant could blossom, a garden that could grow without fear of being stomped on. I became an organic farmer. As I planted seeds, I felt a growing kinship with my plants. I nurtured them as they grew, I cared for them as they matured, and I watched as they ripened and were harvested. They were my children, and I was their mother. As my business grew, I took on more responsibility, training new farmers, organizing work schedules, and purchasing seeds. I took pride in my accomplishments, but I had lost the intimacy I had with my plants. I began to wonder if I had done the right thing. In a fleeting moment, I stood on the side of the road, a truck’s headlights blinding me. A corn plant, uprooted by the passing vehicle, laid across the road. I watched as the green leaves became tattered and dried, and the cob grew heavy with dust. In that moment, I realized that I had lost my way. My goal was to protect my plants, but my actions were killing them. In the future, I will continue to grow my business, but I will also take a step back. I will nurture the land, the seeds, and the farmers, so that my plants may continue to grow. I will become a teacher.
