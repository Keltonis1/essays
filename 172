To my great-grandfather, the world was a different place. He was born in 1905 in the United States. At that time, blacks were discriminated against, forced to live in certain areas, and even denied an education. My great-grandfather, on the other hand, was a man of principle and action. When he was denied a higher education at a school in his hometown, he decided to go to another state, study, and graduate from a prestigious university. Upon his return, he decided to help his community and taught them about the dangers of racial prejudice and the importance of education. His students eventually came to admire him, and he inspired them to continue their education. One of those students was my grandfather. My grandfather also possessed a deep sense of responsibility. When he was old enough to work, he did so, and he also attended school. It was this devotion that led him to meet my grandmother, who would eventually become his wife. Although my great-grandfather had taught my grandfather the importance of education, my grandfather had a different dream. One day, he was at a local store where he met a young man who was interested in buying a home. The man was impressed with my grandfather’s intelligence and hard work, and the two became friends. As the years passed, the man continued to prosper, and eventually, he offered my grandfather the opportunity to be his partner. My grandfather accepted the offer, and he soon became a part of the elite in his town. However, the young man’s success had come at a price. He was a drug dealer, and the two were soon involved in the criminal activity. Although my grandfather had no intention of becoming a criminal, he could not bring himself to abandon his friend. Eventually, he was caught, and he was imprisoned for several years. Although my great-grandfather had inspired my grandfather to become a man of principle and action, my grandfather had become a man of corruption.
