It was the day of the Christmas Eve, and we were all there to celebrate. My sister and I were sitting on the sofa. My parents were preparing dinner in the kitchen. And my grandmother was sitting on the kitchen chair, her back turned to us, making her famous traditional cookies. Her hair was long, and it had already turned grey. She wore a pair of black-framed glasses, which she needed to see clearly. My sister and I, who were only five and six years old, were very excited about Christmas Eve. We wanted to stay up until Santa Claus came, but we were afraid of staying up late. We were eager to taste our grandmotherâ€™s famous cookies, but we were afraid that we would eat too many. We were excited about Santa Claus, but we were afraid that he would not come. Our parents were sitting at the dining table, drinking wine and having a conversation. They were happy because the next day was Christmas. We were happy because Santa Claus would come and give us gifts. My grandmother was preparing the Christmas cookies. She was also happy because it was Christmas. But she was afraid of something. My grandmother was afraid of Santa Claus. She was afraid that he would not come. We were sitting on the sofa, looking at the cookies. We were very excited. The cookies were golden and shiny, and they smelled very good. We were afraid of eating too many. We were afraid of not eating them. We were afraid that Santa Claus would not come. My sister and I had the same thought. We wanted to stay up until Santa Claus came. We wanted to taste the cookies. We wanted to stay with our parents. We wanted to be with our grandmother. We wanted to spend a wonderful Christmas. But we were afraid of staying up late. We were afraid of eating too many cookies. We were afraid that Santa Claus would not come. My sister and I looked at each other. We had made a decision.
