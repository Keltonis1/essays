I was an avid reader as a child. I devoured books like a hungry lion. It was not enough to just read the words; I also enjoyed imagining the characters and the setting. I did not need to see the world on a movie screen. I could see it in my mind. I enjoyed my vivid imagination. But then, when I was nine years old, my parents divorced. That was the first time I ever experienced heartache. It was a difficult time for me. I felt alone, confused, and angry. I would often escape from reality by diving into the world of my imagination. At that time, I found a new love--science fiction. It was the perfect way for me to escape from my current reality and enter a new world. I could imagine the different planets and stars, and I could even imagine myself living on them. My imagination helped me deal with the difficult situation at home. But then, when I was fourteen, my mother remarried. Her new husband was not kind to me. In fact, he was cruel. He used to criticize me for my grades, for my weight, and for the way I dressed. He was jealous of my relationship with my mother. I became afraid of him. But I had no one to talk to. My mother was so blinded by her love for him that she would always believe his words over mine. She was not interested in listening to my stories about him. So, I could not share my feelings with her. My books, my one source of happiness, were taken away from me. I could not find a way to escape from the reality of my life. I became depressed. I began to feel hopeless. I lost all interest in life. I began to eat less and less. I would spend most of my time in my room, not doing anything. I had become a shadow of myself. I was dying. But then, one day, I was visited by an angel.
