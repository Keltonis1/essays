I remember it was one of the most difficult moments of my life. I stood in front of the doors of the hospital room, looking through the glass, and saw my dad lying in bed with a drip in his arm. I saw my dad who had never been in a hospital bed before, who had never had an IV in his arm, and who had never been that weak. The smell of the sterile environment entered my nostrils and lingered. My dad had always been the strong one. My dad had always been the person I could run to whenever I was in trouble. My dad had always been the person I could look up to, the person I wanted to be. But now, he was just a frail old man lying in a hospital bed. I was so shocked. My dad was supposed to be my hero. He was supposed to be the one who saved me from the monsters in my closet, who always knew what to do, who always took care of me. But now, I had to be the one to take care of him. It was hard. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t do anything. I just sat by his bed and cried. I didn’t know what was going to happen to him. I didn’t know if he was going to get better. I didn’t know if he was going to die. I didn’t know what was going to happen to me. I was only a kid. I didn’t know what was going to happen to my family. I just cried. I didn’t know what to do. But my dad knew. My dad told me, “Don’t cry. I’m going to be fine. Everything is going to be okay. You just have to be strong.” He said it with a smile on his face. He told me that everything was going to be okay.
