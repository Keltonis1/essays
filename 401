My name is Chelsea, and I am an American. My family immigrated to America from Colombia when I was five years old. We settled in South Carolina where I was raised for the first five years of my life, and it was there that I began to appreciate America. My parents always instilled in me the pride of being an American, and though I was born in another country, I am proud to be an American. It was not until I was in third grade when I first realized that I was different than those around me. I spoke English with a Spanish accent, and I often made mistakes in my Spanish-speaking assignments. My peers would tease me for being a “gringa” and for not being able to speak Spanish well, and I quickly became embarrassed of my accent. I was ostracized by my classmates for my looks, my culture, my accent, and my Spanish, and I often felt alone. I became increasingly ashamed of my accent and my nationality. I began to believe that I would never be able to fit in, and I started to resent my parents for not teaching me better Spanish. It was then that I began to isolate myself from others. I would not talk to anyone at school, and I would choose to walk home alone rather than walk with my friends. I preferred to be alone in my room rather than being with people. I wanted to be away from them and away from the world that rejected me. I spent most of my time in my room, not talking to anyone and avoiding people. One day, I was in my room, and my father came into my room. He was upset about my behavior and told me that I needed to change. He said to me, “Chelsea, you will never be able to make friends if you do not open up to people. You cannot spend the rest of your life hiding in your room.” I asked him why he thought I was hiding in my room
