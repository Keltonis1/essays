I used to wake up to the sound of my mother making breakfast for my dad. I would lie in bed and listen to the swish of the eggs in the frying pan and the soft, “sizzle” of the sesame oil. I could almost taste the warm, sweet pancakes as they were laid out on the sizzling skillet. I would sit up in bed and stare at the ceiling, imagining how the golden-brown cakes would be delicately folded over and served with a cup of tea. But then, the voices from the kitchen would grow silent. I would walk out of my room to find my mother lying in bed, sobbing, with my father sitting next to her. I would ask, “What’s wrong, mom?” And she would just say, “It’s not the same.” I would sit on the edge of the bed, waiting for her to continue, but she would just keep saying, “It’s not the same.” My mother would lose her appetite and her will to live. She would lay in bed for days, watching the sun shine through the window and the seasons change. Her face was so pale and her eyes were always closed. Her hands would be cold and limp, and her hair would be gray. I could never imagine my mom to be anything but happy and smiling. She was always smiling when she cooked breakfast for my dad. But after my dad died, she was never the same. I used to listen to my mom talk about my dad and the happy times they had together. She would talk about how they would go on a picnic on the weekend and ride bikes together in the park. My mom would say, “Life is too short. You should always be happy and smile.” She was right. My dad died in a car accident, and my mom died soon after. She was only forty-five years
