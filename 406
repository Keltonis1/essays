When I was sixteen, my family and I moved to the United States from my native country of Sri Lanka. I was excited to move into a new house and experience a new school. However, I was also nervous. I knew that I, being the foreign kid, would have to face a lot of prejudice and stereotyping. I knew that I would have to prove myself to my new peers, but I did not know how. I tried to fit in by acting like a typical American teenager. I got a car and a cell phone, dressed in hoodies, and listened to rap music. I tried to eat burgers and French fries every day. I tried to say “bitch” and “douchebag” as much as I could. But I always knew that these were only superficial changes. Deep down inside, I knew that I was still an immigrant. My peers knew it too. This was evident in the way they treated me. The first time I became aware of this was during my sophomore year, when a friend of mine invited me to go ice-skating with him. I was excited. I had never been ice-skating before. I was filled with anticipation and excitement. However, during the middle of the skating session, my friend fell and hurt his arm. When we returned home, I offered to drive him to the hospital. But he told me that he could drive himself and that I should just go home. I was surprised. I had always thought of him as my friend, but he must have thought of me as the immigrant kid who could not be trusted. I was crushed. It was at this moment that I realized that I had to change. I could not be the immigrant kid. I had to be something different. I had to be more than just a foreigner. I had to prove that I was worthy of my peers’ respect and acceptance. I had to be more American than the Americans.
