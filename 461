I grew up playing with my grandmother’s legs. I remember how they would reach out to hug me as I walked into the house. She would smile at me and say, “I love you.” I was always amazed at how soft her skin was. She had beautiful legs, I thought. She wore the softest pants, usually jeans or khakis. Her legs would touch my face and make me feel warm. She always smelled like flowers. She would walk around the house with her walker, then I would see her legs move from one place to another. I could see her body moving, but I couldn’t hear her. I didn’t know why she couldn’t talk. My grandmother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease when I was five. I didn’t know what it was, but I remember thinking that it was an old person’s disease. As I grew older, I began to realize that she was losing her mind. She forgot things, and she would get angry. My grandma was always so nice to me. She would help me with my homework and play with me when I was bored. She always had a kind word to say, but then she began to forget the word for “I”. She would tell me to “eat,” and I would think that she was telling me to eat a cookie. I began to think that she had gone crazy. She forgot how to count and would get confused with the days of the week. She didn’t know where she was going. She didn’t know who she was. She didn’t know who I was. When I was little, I would go over to my grandma’s house almost every day. She would always hug me and tell me that she loved me. She would ask me how school was, and I would tell her that it was good.
