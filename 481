My grandmother used to live with us. She was so kind and funny, always telling me stories about my mom when she was little. I was really young then. She always told me to be a good girl and not cause trouble for my mom. Then she got sick. It was really sad. I remember when I first noticed something was wrong. She used to be able to walk really well, but then she started falling a lot. I got scared. She started forgetting things too. My mom said she had Alzheimer's. I didn't really understand. But I was scared. It was like my grandma was disappearing. Then she had to move into a nursing home. I didn't really want to go see her. I was scared. I remember the first time I went. She didn't know who I was. She didn't even know my name. I started crying. I was so scared. Then she said, "Oh, hi little Kimmy!" I just cried harder. She didn't know who I was. She had no idea who I was. Then I just said, "Hi Grandma." I was just glad she remembered me. Then she started telling me stories. She started talking to me. She told me about when my mom was little and when my uncle was little. It was so funny. I really liked it. It was like she knew me. It was like she really knew me. I really liked it. Then she got really sick. She started forgetting things. She forgot my name. She forgot who my mom was. She forgot everything. I didn't like it. I didn't like it at all. I didn't like seeing her like that. It was like my grandma was disappearing. I didn't like it at all. Then she had to move into a nursing home. It was like a hospital. It was like she was dying. I didn't want to go see her. I was scared. I was so scared
