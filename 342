With my freshman year of college approaching, my parents still hadn’t found me an internship. I had heard enough about the heartache of finding a good one: late hours, hard work, and no pay. The last thing I wanted was to fall into a situation like the one my best friend was in. “Mochi,” I said, “your internship sucks. You have to stay at the office until midnight, and you don’t even get paid!” “That’s cool,” she replied. “I’m learning a lot, I’m getting to know the CEO, and I’m getting a lot of great experience.” “I don’t care about experience!” I said. “I’m not a sucker. I’m smart, and I know I deserve something better.” I had to get an internship that paid at least minimum wage. Anything less than that was just plain wrong. I had worked hard to get into a good college, and I wasn’t going to let my parents waste my talent just because they were too cheap to pay me. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started looking for internships online. After a week of searching, I finally found one that seemed perfect. It paid $10 an hour, and it involved working for a big-name company downtown. I told my parents about it, but they still insisted that I take whatever internship they found. “How is this going to help me get a job after I graduate?” I asked them. “I want to work for a company I can brag about.” Then my mother started crying. I was shocked. She never cries. And it was rare for her to argue with me. “You’re our only child,” she said.
