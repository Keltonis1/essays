Salt was the first ingredient I learned to recognize, the first taste I learned to relish. Salt is almost a universal ingredient in Korean cuisine. Salt is the most basic of all tastes. As a child, I remember adding a little pinch of salt to my rice. As I grew older, I learned to enjoy the taste of saltiness, the pleasure of savoring the flavor of salt, and the satisfaction of cooking with salt. In my last year of middle school, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a terrible shock for me, but I tried to hide my grief. I tried to be strong for my family. I tried to hold everything in. I did my best to be the man of the house. However, the more I tried to be strong, the more I was consumed by fear and a sense of helplessness. I was only 15. I did not know how to help my mother. Cooking became my only source of relief. In my kitchen, I could be alone with my thoughts and emotions. In my kitchen, I could express my love through food. I could be my motherâ€™s son, her hope, her strength. I could be her hero. I could show her that the most important thing in my life was still her. Whenever she came over, I would put on a smile and pretend everything was okay. But in the kitchen, I would let my tears fall. I would be the son that I could not be in the living room. I would be the hero that I could not be in my dreams. In my kitchen, I would cook the best meal I could. I would cook the meals that I thought would make her happy. I would cook the meals that I thought would make her well again. I would cook the meals that I thought would make her whole again. In my kitchen, I would cook for my mother, and in the process, I would discover my life.
