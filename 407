It is the middle of July. I have been up since 4:30 in the morning, riding my bike in the heat, on the verge of dehydration. I have not eaten for hours, and I am starving. But I do not have time to stop. I am at the finish line, my lungs on fire, my legs trembling. My muscles are in pain, and I can barely breathe. I am exhausted. My body feels like it has been through a war, and it is telling me to stop. I ignore it. I can’t. There is a finish line ahead of me, and I have to cross it. I have been running for an hour, and my pace is slowing down. I look behind me and see the pack of runners that started with me. I can’t tell how far they are behind me. All I know is that I can’t stop. I keep running. I feel like I am in a trance, my eyes staring at the finish line ahead of me, not even thinking about anything else. My legs feel heavy, but I don’t stop. I feel the pain in my muscles, but I don’t stop. I keep running. I reach the finish line, and I collapse on the ground. I am done. I have finished my first half marathon. I feel like I have been through a war, and I have won. I have completed my first challenge. But I know that I will not be the only one to face these challenges. They will be faced by everyone. Everyone is struggling. Everyone is fighting. Everyone is a runner.
