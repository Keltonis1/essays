My grandmother lives in a small apartment on the east coast of Taiwan. When I am home, I go to see her every week. When I get off the train, I walk a few blocks to her place. The streets are narrow and crowded. Sometimes, it takes me longer to get to her house than it does to get to school. But I don’t mind. I am never in a hurry. I walk slowly and stop to look at the little shops along the way. It’s a tradition of mine to buy something to eat on the way to see my grandmother. I always pick out something that she likes, too. I arrive at her apartment. The doorman lets me in. I go up to her apartment on the fourth floor. She is waiting for me by the door. She smiles and greets me in her soft voice. I go inside. I bring her some treats from the market. We have tea together and I tell her about my week. Then we go to a restaurant nearby. She picks out a table. We order a meal. We eat slowly and talk about everything. I tell her about school. She tells me about her friends. I ask her about my grandfather. She tells me about his health. Then we walk back home. She walks slowly. I take her hand and help her. She smiles. I help her get on the train. I say goodbye and go back to my life.
