The moon is smiling at me, his mouth twisted in a ghoulish grin. The dim glow of the stars does little to illuminate his ghastly face. He is mocking me, laughing at me. He knows that my chances of success are slim, but I do not care. I am a scientist, and it is my duty to explore every avenue. So here I am, venturing out to a place that many would deem inhospitable, but I find exciting. I look up at the sky, and I smile. I smile because I know that I am taking the first step towards an understanding of the universe. I have a goal. I will go to the moon. Not because I have any chance of success, but because I am a scientist. I must be a scientist. I am not a rocket scientist, nor am I a scientist who works in a lab. I am a scientist who is not afraid to take risks, to explore the unknown, and to understand the universe. I am a scientist, and it is my duty to explore every avenue. I have always been fascinated by the stars. From the moment I was born, they were there. They watched over me. They showed me the way. When I was a young boy, I asked my father what the lights in the sky were. He told me they were stars. I asked him what they were. He said they were suns, and they were far away. I asked him how they could be suns if they were so far away. He said they were suns because they were very big. I was not satisfied with this answer, and I told him so. He smiled and said, “They are suns because that is what they are called.” He told me that the stars were always there, even when we could not see them. He said that when the sky was dark, the stars were hiding. I did not understand why the stars hid.
