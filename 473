Every night, as the clock strikes midnight, my mother lights a stick of incense and bows her head in prayer. Although I am too young to understand her words, I can see that she is praying for her deceased father. Her father, my grandfather, had passed away when I was only six months old. My grandfather had been the head of our family. After his death, my mother became a single mother with two children. I am a freshman in high school, and my sister is in the third grade. Every morning, I see my mother preparing my sister’s lunchbox. Although I don’t understand why she does this, I know it’s for my grandfather. When my mother passes away, I know I will not be able to bear the burden of raising my sister alone. It’s a responsibility I don’t want to bear. I don’t want my sister to be the one to take care of me when I am old. I want to take care of her. I want to be the one to carry her lunchbox to school. I want to be the one to wipe her tears. I want to be the one to tell her that everything is going to be okay. I want to be the one to hold her hand when she gets scared. I want to be the one to tell her that everything is going to be alright. I don’t want to be the one to cry. I don’t want to be the one to suffer. I don’t want to be the one to suffer from loneliness. I want to be the one to make her laugh. I want to be the one to smile at her. I want to be the one to love her. I don’t want to be the one to be alone. I don’t want to be the one to be sad. I don’t want to be the one to feel sad
