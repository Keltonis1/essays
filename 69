My grandmother has always been the life of the party. When I was little, I used to sneak into the living room to peek at her dancing. She would be wearing a bright red shirt with long black pants. Her hair was pulled back, and she had earrings in both ears. She would look beautiful. She would always have a smile on her face. She would have a cigarette in her hand, and she would be dancing to the Korean music that she liked. I loved it when she would dance. It was a wonderful thing to watch. I would watch her for a long time. I would be there for a long time, and she would dance for a long time. Sometimes, I would leave and go back in. I would just watch her for hours. She would look beautiful when she danced. She would always smile. She would always be happy. It made me happy to see her happy. I liked seeing her happy. My grandma loved to dance. I never got tired of watching her. I would always look forward to seeing her dance. I would watch her whenever she was in the living room. My grandma has always been the life of the party. She always made people happy. She made me happy. She made my mom happy. She made my uncle happy. She made my aunts happy. She made my cousins happy. She made my friends happy. She made everybody happy. My grandma has always been the life of the party. I will always remember her dancing.
