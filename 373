I've spent my whole life trying to make the best of what I've got. It's been a constant struggle to maintain the balance of what's really important and what's not. I never thought I'd be at a place where I'd be able to recognize the fine line between these two things. I thought I'd be better prepared. The reality is, however, I'm not. I am in the midst of the most difficult situation of my life. I've always been very optimistic, and that has carried me through many tough times. But the struggle I'm facing now is something I don't know how to overcome. My brother was in a car accident on December 3rd. The impact from the crash killed him instantly. It was devastating news to our family. I knew he was a good kid and a great brother. He was only 22 years old. He had just started his own company with his business partner. They had been working on this venture for two years, and it was finally starting to gain traction. His business partner, Steve, is a great guy and a true friend. My brother was like a brother to me. We had always been close. I looked up to him, and I admired his passion for life. He was someone who always tried to do the right thing. My brother and I both shared a passion for motorcycles. He always wanted to race, and I wanted to teach him. He had a dream to be a professional racer, and I wanted to help him achieve that dream. In the end, though, it was his decision to quit racing and start his business. I was supportive of his decision because I knew he had found something that made him happy. He was always happiest when he was working on something. I'm not going to pretend to know what heaven is like. But I do know that my brother was a great person. He had a heart of gold, and he was the best brother I could have ever asked for
