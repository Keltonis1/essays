 My grandmother and I have a close relationship. I can talk to her about anything and she’s always there for me. She taught me how to cook and is always there to help me with my homework. I can always count on her. But her memory is starting to fade. It started when I was in the 8th grade. I told her that I wanted to be a doctor. Her reaction was that of someone who has never heard of a doctor before. This hurt me a lot. I tried to explain to her what a doctor does. But she just doesn’t seem to care. I am worried that one day she will forget me. The stress of these worries is getting to me. I worry about it all the time. I feel like I don’t have a real family anymore. My mom and dad are always in their own worlds and they don’t care about what I am feeling. I want to cry sometimes but I just can’t let it out. I’m afraid that if I let it out, I won’t be able to stop crying. I don’t want to burden my grandmother, so I don’t tell her how I am feeling. But I don’t know when I will be able to tell her. I don’t know when she will be able to understand me. I don’t know if I will be able to understand her.
