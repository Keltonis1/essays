The doctors have given me six months to live. When I told my parents, my father sat silently in his chair. The house was deathly quiet. My mother was in the kitchen making dinner. She was preparing for my funeral. My father eventually spoke. “It’s okay, my son. I’m going to help you finish your education.” My father was a migrant worker. He never finished high school. My mother also never went to school. I knew that my father was trying to give me a better future. I did not want to disappoint him. I became a model student. I got perfect scores on every test. I got all As in every class. I was on the honor roll. I became the captain of the debate team. I worked hard and did my best. I was always the first one to arrive at school and the last one to leave. I did everything I could to help my father give me a better future. I did not want to die. I did not want to disappoint my father. I was the top student in my class. I was the best debater in my school. I worked hard to do my best. But my father died before I graduated. My father was not there when I graduated. I did not want to die. I did not want to disappoint my father. My father was not there when I graduated. I did not want to die. I did not want to disappoint my father. My father was not there when I graduated. I did not want to die. I did not want to disappoint my father. My father was not there when I graduated. I did not want to die. I did not want to disappoint my father. My father was not there when I graduated. I did not want to die. I did not want to disappoint my father. My father was not there when I graduated. I did not want to die. I did not want to disappoint my father
