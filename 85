It was a dark and rainy evening in the summer of 1997. A small boy in a big park looked up at his mother and smiled. The clouds swirled in the sky, and he felt like a boy who had just seen the moon for the first time. He was so happy that he was able to make her smile back. This was his first memory. But the happy days were about to end. The boy, only four years old, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This disease was incurable, and he was going to die. His name was David. The treatment was expensive and long, but David and his mother had to give up everything else to afford it. As he was treated, he began to feel that the only thing that mattered was to live. He wanted to play with other kids and go to school. But he was always told that he couldn’t. As a result, he began to think that he wasn’t worth much, that he was a burden to everyone. In reality, his mother and father worked hard to save his life. But in his mind, he was the one who was dying. It took him two years to finish the treatment. The cancer cells in his body had been destroyed, but his body was so weak that he could not even hold a glass of water. The doctor said that he would never be able to have children. David was very sad. He thought he would never be able to do anything like other kids. He wanted to play basketball, but he could not even run. He wanted to play with toys, but he was too weak to pick them up. David was a quiet boy. He didn’t like to talk about his feelings, so he would stay at home and read books. He was very curious about the world and wanted to know how everything worked. He was especially interested in technology. In his free time, he would read books about computers and their history.
