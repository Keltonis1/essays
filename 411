My grandmother and I sat on the porch of her mobile home on a breezy spring afternoon. She had just turned eighty years old and I had just turned eighteen. She told me stories of her childhood, her youth, and her motherhood, and I listened intently. She told me about her parents and her childhood friends, and I listened eagerly. She told me about the place where she grew up, and I listened reverently. I listened to the voice that had always been there, had always cared, and had always been a pillar of strength. It was a voice that I had always heard, but I had never heard it. I never knew the history of her life until she shared it with me. I listened to the voice of my grandmother, and I knew it was the voice of a strong woman. It was the voice of a woman who had worked hard her whole life, had raised three children on her own, and had struggled through the pain of a broken heart. It was the voice of a woman who had traveled to the far reaches of the world, who had climbed the tallest of mountains, and who had survived a terrible accident. It was the voice of a woman who had endured, had fought, and had overcome. I knew the voice was the voice of a strong woman, but I never knew the voice was my grandmother’s. I had never known my grandmother’s voice until she shared her story with me. I never knew my grandmother’s story until she told it to me. I listened to the voice of my grandmother, and I knew it was the voice of a strong woman.
