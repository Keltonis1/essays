My grandparents came to the United States with nothing but the clothes on their backs. They worked their way through college, raised their children, and sacrificed their youth for their families. They did all of this with their minds set on a better future. My grandparents were never rich. They had no trust funds, no inheritances, and no golden parachutes. They simply worked. My grandparents raised four children on a salary of less than $25,000 a year. They sent their children to the best schools, provided for their needs, and took care of them in every way possible. They instilled in me the values of honesty, hard work, and integrity. They taught me to be grateful for the things I have and not to take them for granted. My grandparents’ influence has had a profound impact on my life. I have chosen to honor their values and work hard for the things I want. They taught me to work hard, to be responsible, and to do what I love. My grandmother’s favorite hobby was sewing. When I was young, she taught me to sew, to cook, and to bake. She taught me how to love and care for others. She taught me how to care for a family. She taught me to be a good wife. My grandmother’s life was dedicated to her family. She instilled in me the values that I now carry with me through life. She was the best example of a loving wife and a dedicated mother. She was the best example of how to make a good life for your family.
