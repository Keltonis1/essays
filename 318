 It’s hard to understand that your father is dying.

I knew my dad was sick. He had been fighting cancer for a long time. But I never wanted to admit that he was going to die.

I knew my dad was sick. He had been fighting cancer for a long time. But I never wanted to admit that he was going to die.

One day, I was watching TV when my aunt came into my room and said, “Your dad is in the hospital.”

I ran to the hospital. I couldn’t believe what I saw. My dad was lying in his bed. He had lost so much weight. He was dying.

I was too shocked to cry.

My dad held my hand and said, “Son, I am going to die.”

“No, it’s not true,” I said.

But my dad did die. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. My dad’s death taught me that you should never take anything for granted.

I miss my dad. I wish he were here. But I know that God will take care of him.
