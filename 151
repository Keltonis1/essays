The day I saw the saiga antelope, I felt as if I had found my soul mate. He was the last of his kind. We were the last of our kind. The saiga antelope was my favorite animal growing up. The first time I saw one, I was shocked at how close it was. The antelope's long, curved horns were intimidating at first, but it quickly became apparent that they made the animal look noble. I saw my face in them, my pain in them. They were like my spirit animal: a spirit that could never be broken, a spirit that was pure at heart. I felt pity for the saiga antelope, because they were hunted to near-extinction. Their horns were used for decorations and thought to have medicinal properties. However, I was thankful that they had escaped extinction. In my mind, they were a symbol of revival. When I found out that the saiga antelope had been declared extinct, I felt utter disbelief. How could that happen? How could such a noble creature be gone? Yet I knew the answer. We had killed it. My family had hunted the saiga antelope to extinction, for sport, for money, for nothing. My family had killed the animal I had loved since I was a child. Yet the saiga antelope wasn’t truly extinct. I was still alive. That was when I decided to dedicate my life to animals. I wanted to study them and learn their habits. I wanted to learn how to protect them, to protect my soul mate. I didn’t want to see another animal go extinct, another soul mate go extinct. I had failed the saiga antelope. I wasn’t going to fail again.
