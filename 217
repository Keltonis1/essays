I am no longer sure whether it was the day before Thanksgiving or the day after. I was sixteen years old and my family was in the midst of cooking a feast for my grandparents. In the middle of prepping and cooking, I saw my dad's face. He was staring out the kitchen window. His eyes had a glazed look and his mouth was slightly open. He seemed to be staring at something, but I could not tell what. I turned to look at what had caught his attention. My grandmother, in her wheelchair, was heading towards the street. I knew she was trying to get out of the house. I yelled to my dad to grab the wheelchair. He rushed over to my grandmother and put his hands on the wheelchair to stop her. My grandmother struggled against my dad's hold on the wheelchair. I ran over to help him, but it was too late. My grandmother was already outside the house, wheeling herself towards the busy street. The sun was setting. The street was full of cars, but fortunately no one was driving. My grandmother was moving very slowly. She seemed to be in her own world, as if she were watching something that only she could see. I felt as if I were watching a movie. I could not believe what was happening. My grandmother was trying to get out of the house again. I felt very scared and worried about what might happen to her. My grandmother moved a little faster, still not looking at the street. The cars started to drive faster. I wanted to run out and stop my grandmother, but I was scared that I might get hit by a car if I ran out. My grandmother was almost at the street. A car was coming. I yelled to my dad to run out and stop her. He did not move. I yelled again. He finally got up and ran outside. My grandmother reached the street. The car was very close. I closed my eyes and prayed that nothing bad would happen.
