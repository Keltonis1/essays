My grandmother, Kwon Yong-ok, was born in 1935, in the final years of the Japanese occupation of Korea. She was the third of six children, and her childhood was spent in a tiny village about a day’s walk from Seoul. Her father was a farmer, and as soon as her brothers were old enough, they began working on the farm. Her parents, like many of their neighbors, were so poor that they could not even afford to pay for their children’s education. My grandmother was therefore an uneducated peasant girl.

However, that year, her youngest son, her favorite, was diagnosed with a serious illness. He was afflicted with severe rickets, a bone-softening disease that was, and still is, endemic in Korea. Her son’s illness was especially bad, and he would have died, had it not been for an American missionary, Dr. Thomas David, who provided free medical care to poor Korean children.

The treatment worked, and my father survived his childhood illness. My grandmother was grateful to the missionary for his help, and she was also thankful to God. My grandmother was a deeply religious woman, and she made it her life
