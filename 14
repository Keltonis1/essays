I remember when my mother was alive. She was always the life of the party, but it was a lot of work being the life of the party. She would spend hours planning for parties: making the food, decorating the house, and picking out what I would wear. When the party started, she would dance and sing with the guests. She would play games with me and my friends. She was always the first to start singing, and the last to stop. Then one day, my mom died. I was nine years old. When my mom died, the life of the party died too. The house wasn’t as bright and colorful as it used to be. I felt as if the color had been sucked out of everything. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I was surprised to see that I was wearing the same outfit that I had worn to my mother’s funeral. The food that my mom had cooked for her party was still sitting on the counter. I didn’t know what to do with the food. It just sat there for days. I knew that if I didn’t eat it, it would go bad. But I couldn’t eat it. It was my mom’s food. My mom had made it. My mom had touched it. I didn’t know how to touch it. I couldn’t eat it. I remember the first time I ate after my mom died. It was spaghetti. I didn’t have a choice. My dad had cooked spaghetti for dinner, and I had to eat it. My dad had cooked it. He had touched it. It was his food. It didn’t matter that I couldn’t eat. It didn’t matter that I didn’t want to eat. I had to eat. I couldn’t let it go to waste. I didn’t want to be wasteful
