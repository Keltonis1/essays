I was always the kind of girl who thought about the future. I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up and I was pretty confident that I would make it. I was the first person in my family to go to college, but I had worked my whole life to make it happen. In my first year, I met my best friend, Janet. We were both really into school and doing well. We went to the same high school and were in the same classes, but we didn’t really know each other that well. But when we got to college, we started to hang out more. I liked her because she was funny and always knew how to make me laugh. She was also really smart. She was a lot like me. One day, Janet was complaining about having to take a math test that she wasn’t sure she was ready for. I was a math major, so I offered to help her study. We went to the library and I went through the practice problems with her. I made her go through all the problems until she got them right. We spent a lot of time together studying and hanging out. I was really into school, but Janet was more into her friends. She always seemed to be out partying. I didn’t really have time for that. She told me she was really stressed about school and didn’t have time to study. I told her that she should try to study harder, but she just said she couldn’t handle it. She said she was going to drop out. I told her she couldn’t do that, but she said she had to. She said she was going to go home and try to get a job. She said she was going to live with her mom and dad and just take some time off. I didn’t know what to say. I knew she didn’t have a job, but I thought she would stay in school
