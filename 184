When I was little, my mother would often tell me, “You have to be a man.” Her words were a response to my tears, which she thought were unmanly. I was born with eyes that were different from my father’s, so he always told me to be a man because I looked like his mother. It was so confusing to me. I didn’t understand why I should be a man. I just wanted to be a boy. I didn’t want to be either. When I was five years old, my mom told me that my uncle was going to stay with us for a while. He was a tall, handsome man who lived in America, and I thought he must be a superhero. He would play with me and tell me stories, and I would always listen to him. He made me feel like a man. I was so happy that I had a brother. But the story didn’t end happily. My uncle was diagnosed with leukemia and died when I was six. My father never came home from work that day; he locked himself in the room and wept. I didn’t know what happened. My father and I never talked about it. I was nine when my father started to get sick. His belly kept growing, and he would vomit in the middle of the night. I would wake up and feel his forehead—he was always so hot. My dad was the strongest man I knew, and I didn’t know what to do when he was sick. When he got worse, I couldn’t stand to be in the house and ran away to my grandparents’ house. I was there for a while, but I kept thinking about my dad. Finally, I went home. When I got there, my dad was in bed and my mom was crying. I went into the room and asked my dad if he was okay. He said he was fine
