The first time my grandmother got sick, she was still young and full of life. Though I was only ten years old, I remember how she struggled to put on a brave face, pretending that the lump in her breast wasn’t anything to worry about. Out of respect, my parents and I did the same. However, I was still a child, and I was scared. I didn’t want her to leave me; I didn’t want her to die. I didn’t want her to be sick. In my eyes, she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and I couldn’t accept the idea that she would be sick, let alone die. My grandmother’s sickness made me realize that life was not always fair. Despite the way I felt, my grandmother underwent surgery to remove the lump. If I hadn’t seen the scar left on her breast, I would never have believed that she had been sick at all. She was so happy and enthusiastic about life after the successful procedure, as if she had never been sick in the first place. I was so relieved by her recovery that I had completely forgotten how frightened I had been. A few years later, my grandmother grew weaker and began to spend a lot of time in bed. She had always been a hardworking woman, but now she couldn’t even walk out of the house on her own. I was no longer a little boy afraid of the idea of losing her, but I still couldn’t bear to see my grandmother so weak and helpless. Her sickness made me realize that life was not always fair, but her recovery made me realize that although life may not always be fair, it is always precious. I am now fifteen, and I have never forgotten the lessons I learned from my grandmother. Her illness taught me how to be brave, and her recovery taught me how to appreciate life. I still remember the day she passed
