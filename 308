The day I got the call, I was sitting in the living room of my small apartment. It was mid-October, and the leaves were just beginning to change. I remember looking out the window at the newly-orange and red trees and thinking how much they resembled the color of fire. The phone rang, and I answered. “Hello,” I said, somewhat distracted by the view. “Hi, Jin?” It was my mom. “Yeah?” I replied, not recognizing her voice. “This is Mom.” “Oh, hey,” I said, still not sure. “What’s up?” “Oh, nothing.” I waited for her to continue. I thought she might be calling about something for school. I was an incoming junior, after all. “I’m calling because…I have some bad news,” she said, pausing. “What is it?” I asked. I was scared. I couldn’t think of anything that would require a phone call. “It’s your grandma.” “What about her?” I was still confused. “She had a heart attack,” she said. “Is she okay?” “She’s in the hospital. She’s not going to make it.” My heart dropped. I didn’t know what to say. I was in shock. My grandma was everything to me. She was my mom, my dad, my best friend, and my hero. She was always there for me. I could talk to her about anything, and she always knew what to say. She was always on my side, even if she didn’t always agree with me. She was always there for me. I was twelve when she moved in with us.
