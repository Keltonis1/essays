This winter, as the temperature dropped to below zero, I took my dog out for her morning walk. Although the sidewalk was covered in a layer of ice, my dog didn’t mind. She enjoyed the brisk air and played around in the snow. However, I was cold, and when I looked up, I saw my breath coming out in small white puffs. I had to get back inside. So I turned around and began to walk home. But as I began to walk, I saw my dog had fallen behind and was trying to walk across the ice. She slipped and fell, landing with a thud on her side. Her eyes darted around and her tail stood straight up. She didn’t know what to do. I rushed over to her and gently picked her up. As I held her in my arms, she licked my face. She was happy that I was helping her, but I could tell she was in pain. I took her inside and put her on the couch. I tried to find a bandage to put on her hurt paw, but I couldn’t find one. I had to improvise, so I put a sock on her paw and tried to give her some medicine to make her feel better. She took the medicine and rested on the couch. She didn’t move for the rest of the day. I took care of her for the next week. I made sure she was fed and got plenty of rest. Every day I gave her medicine to help her feel better. Slowly, she started to get better. After a week, she was able to run around again and play with my other dog. It was hard to take care of her when I was so busy, but I was glad that I was able to help her. She was able to recover from her injury because I took care of her. It made me realize that we need to take care of the Earth like we took care of
