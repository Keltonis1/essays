My grandmother was a woman of few words but many stories. Her tales were always centered around one theme: life as a woman in rural South Korea. A country of 48,000 islands, South Korea is composed of rural villages, where my grandmother lived until she moved to the city in her twenties. Yet, her stories always seemed to focus on the same topic: the extreme hardships that she and other women endured, both in the past and present. Grandmother was born in the early 1900s when South Korea was under Japanese rule. In the oppressive patriarchal society, women were treated like second-class citizens. They were not permitted to attend school and were forced to stay at home to do most household chores. In my grandmother's generation, women were not expected to speak unless spoken to. When they did speak, it was to be polite and respectful, and they were to avoid any form of confrontation. Women were to be seen and not heard--a rule that my grandmother did not always follow in her later years. After World War II, South Korea was liberated from Japanese rule. However, women were still at a disadvantage in terms of education and career opportunities. My grandmother did not receive any formal education until she was in her twenties and was a housewife until she was in her forties. Women were not allowed to leave the house without their husband's or father's permission. Throughout her life, my grandmother lived in a society that was dominated by men. For the most part, she was able to cope with the hardships that life had dealt her, but she still carried the scars. In high school, my grandmother was forced to drop out because the local government would not allow her to attend school past the age of fifteen. For the majority of her life, my grandmother had to deal with the pressures of finding a husband. While most of her peers were able to find a husband in their early twenties, my grandmother had an unusually hard time finding a mate in her late twenties.
