On May 17, 2007, I received the first and last call of my life from my mother. “I’m sorry, Dong Jin,” she said. “Grandma has passed away.” As I hung up the phone, I felt as though the world had fallen out from under me. The death of a family member is a wound that never heals. That is why I am an oncologist.
