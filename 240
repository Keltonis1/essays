Every time I go home, I would sit with my mom and talk about the world. She always wanted to know what I learned in school, what I thought about it, and what I was going to do with my life. However, one question that always caught me off guard was her inquiry about what I thought about love. In response, I would say that love was not very important, but she insisted that I was wrong. She would tell me that she knew that I was a boy who was in love. I thought she was crazy. I was not in love with anyone. Then, one day, I realized that she was right. I had been in love with the same person for years. I did not know how to express it, but I loved her and I knew that she loved me too. Then, I understood that love was the most important thing in the world. I knew that my mom had loved me, and she knew that I loved her. But, for some reason, I was afraid to say it. I did not want to tell her because I was afraid of what she would think of me. She had raised me to be a nice person, and if I told her that I loved her, I would be a bad person. So, I kept my feelings to myself. However, when she died, I regretted not telling her how much I loved her. Even though she knew, I did not tell her. She could not hear it from me. That was the first time I realized that love is a gift that we can give to the people we love. When we love someone, we should tell them. We should tell them that we love them. We should tell them so that they know.
