"Grandpa, did you know that the car has been here for two days?" I asked as I walked into his hospital room. "It’s been here for a week.” He replied with a chuckle. "Grandpa, do you know what day it is?" I asked again. "Tuesday.” He replied without a moment’s hesitation. "What is today’s date?" I questioned again. "July 20th.” He answered without hesitation. I was taken aback. My grandfather had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s only a few months ago. In just a few short months, he had forgotten how to recognize the day, the month, and the year. How could he remember that the car had been sitting in the driveway for a week? How could he tell me what day it was and what day it was in July? How could he remember that it was Tuesday? And then it dawned on me. My grandfather was not losing his memory; he was gaining a new kind of memory. My grandfather had forgotten how to count, how to write, how to speak. But he had not forgotten how to love. In a time where we are becoming increasingly more disconnected from the people around us, my grandfather has taught me that it is in the simplest of acts that we can find the most meaning. And it is in those simple acts that we can be the most human. I’ve never met a person who loves more purely than my grandfather. He is more in love with my grandmother today than the day they were married. Every day he looks forward to seeing her. He remembers her with every fiber of his being. It is in these simple memories that he has found his greatest happiness. And it is in this happiness that I have found mine.
