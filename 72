After graduating from college, I realized that I had learned more than I ever had imagined. I had learned that there are no teachers in the classroom who are infallible. I had learned that some people’s idea of teaching is only limited to test scores and grades. I had learned that most of my teachers were only concerned about their own jobs and not about the students’ future. I had learned that I needed to learn by myself. I had learned that I could only do this by not taking anything for granted. I had learned that I had to work harder to understand the things I was being taught. I had learned that I had to do my own research, not depend on the teachers to give me the answer. I had learned that I had to make my own mistakes, learn from them, and then move on. I had learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to be different. And I had learned that I had to choose my own path. I had learned all of these lessons by doing my own research. In my research, I found many interesting things. For example, in our current educational system, there are two different standards of learning. One standard is what is taught in the classroom and what is on the test. The other standard is what is taught in the classroom and what is not on the test. Teachers teach the first standard, and students learn the first standard. Students then go to the testing center and learn the second standard. The second standard is what is most important. It is what is needed to get a good job. It is what is needed to make a good living. It is what is needed to live a good life. What I am saying is that we are learning two different standards of learning. And what I am also saying is that it is the second standard that is most important. What is more important is that I am learning this second standard by doing my own research.
