After my grandmother passed away, I was angry at myself. I couldn’t understand why I didn’t visit her more often. I knew she was lonely. I was living on my own for the first time, and it was difficult for me to visit her in the nursing home. It was my job to take care of her. I thought that if I had visited her more often, she would not have been so lonely and would have had more time to spend with her grandchildren. When my grandmother first got sick, I thought she was just getting old and would get better soon. I was living on the other side of the country and did not know that she had cancer. I never visited her in the hospital. I did not realize that her cancer was spreading and would soon take her life. I was too busy to spend time with her. When she got sick, I did not take the time to go see her. I felt very guilty about that. My grandmother was a very nice lady. She had a strong will and never gave up on life. She was always there for me and my family. She always helped us and gave us advice. I did not do the same for her. She died when I was nineteen years old. I had to grow up quickly after she died. I was very close to her. I miss her a lot. I wish I could have spent more time with her before she died. I am trying to be a better person and to visit my family more often. I am not afraid of death. It is just a part of life. When it is my time to go, I hope I can go in peace. I hope my family will remember me and know that I love them.
