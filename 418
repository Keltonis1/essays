As I sat at the kitchen table, watching my mom bake a chocolate cake, I knew I had to tell her. It was my last day at home before I went back to school. My dad would be gone the next day, and I had to get the words out before I lost my nerve. I had to tell her about what I had done. I had to tell her that I had sex with a girl. My mom pulled the cake out of the oven and placed it on the stove. She turned on the burner to cool the cake. I was about to speak, but I couldn’t. I had a lot of excuses for why I did what I did, but I knew that they wouldn’t make her understand. The first time I had sex was with a girl I knew from school. We had been flirting for a while, and one night we decided to go to the beach and drink. I was drunk and didn’t know what I was doing. I was still a virgin, but that night I lost it. I felt horrible the next day. I knew I had to tell my mom, but I didn’t know how to. I had never lied to her, and I didn’t want to start now. So I decided to tell her the truth. I looked at her and took a deep breath. “Mom, I have something to tell you.” “What is it, honey?” she asked. “Well, I…I…” I stammered. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t tell her. I couldn’t look at her face. “I’m pregnant.” I said. “I’m pregnant.” I looked up at her, and she was standing there with a look of total shock. “I’m pregnant.” “
