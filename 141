“To give your life for another.” My eyes were glued to the TV, watching in disbelief as the collapse of the Twin Towers unfolded. The images on the screen were horrifying--people trapped inside the building, covered in dust, and screaming for help. The death toll was rising. My mind raced. “How could anyone be so despicable as to do this?” I thought. The faces of the people trapped inside flickered across the screen. If we had a way of getting them out, we had to do so. The government needed to do something. We had to do something. But nothing was done. The clock continued ticking, and the people inside continued to perish. I was in the second grade when the 9/11 attacks happened. I was old enough to understand that something tragic had happened, but too young to know what to do about it. What was I supposed to do? Was there something I could do? The next day, I went to school. Everyone in the classroom was talking about it. The teacher was teaching as usual. The TV was on in the classroom. And nobody was doing anything about it. I couldn’t just sit there and do nothing; so I went to the board. I wrote down, “We should build a memorial.” I showed it to my teacher. How could I have expected her to understand the magnitude of what I was trying to say? I don’t even understand the magnitude of it myself. To me, it was just a simple way of saying, “I’m here. This happened. We should do something about it.” But, to her, I was just a kid who wanted to draw on the board. Maybe she didn’t want to be bothered. Maybe she was busy trying to keep her own kids under control. Who knows? The only thing I know is that I can blame her for not doing anything
