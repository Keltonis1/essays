My grandmother has a special relationship with the mountain. She calls it her “best friend” and talks about it with passion. Whenever I go home to visit, she will ask me, “What did you do today?” and then tell me about the mountain. She will talk about the trails, the trees, the animals, and the birds. I love to hear her talk about the mountain because it reminds me of my childhood. I grew up in this same city, but I was not aware of the mountain. In my early childhood, I was always at home with my grandma because my parents were working. Whenever my grandma and I would walk outside, I would always be in a hurry to get back inside. I didn’t want to be outside. I didn’t like the wind, the snow, or the sun. I wanted to be inside where it was warm and cozy. My grandma would take me to the playground and push me on the swings, but I always wanted to get off. She would take me to the park and I would not play on the jungle gym. I didn’t want to go on the slide. I didn’t want to go on the merry-go-round. I didn’t want to go on the teeter-totter. I just wanted to sit on the bench. Then, one day, my grandma took me to the mountain. We hiked up the mountain, and I was very tired. My grandma said, “Let’s sit here for a while.” She told me that the mountain was special. She told me that the mountain was the heart of the city. She told me that the mountain was very old. She told me that the mountain was beautiful. She told me that the mountain was strong. She told me that the mountain had trees, flowers, grass, and animals. She told me that the mountain was special
