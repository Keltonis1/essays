One day, my grandma came home from the grocery store with a bag of apples. She took out a small knife, cut one of the apples in half, and began to peel off the skin. But she paused. She held the half-apple in her wrinkled hands, her eyes glazed over as she stared at the apple. Though her mind was far from the kitchen, she continued peeling the apple. She peeled and peeled and peeled until the apple was completely free of its skin. The peels piled up around her feet, like a pile of red and yellow leaves that had fallen from the trees.

It was late, and I knew I should sleep, but I was worried. What if she forgot to turn off the stove? What if she fell asleep? What if she forgot to lock the door and a burglar came in through the window? I lay awake, unable to sleep, watching the clock tick away the minutes, one after another. I heard a car pull into the driveway. It was my mom. I jumped out of bed and ran to the door. My mom opened it, and I ran to her, hugged her, and cried into her shoulder. “Is she okay?” I asked. “What’s wrong with her?” “She’s just old,” my mom said. “She’s sick.” My grandma came into the kitchen, her hair mussed and her eyes glassy. She was holding the half-peeled apple in her hand
