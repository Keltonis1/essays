But I was also kind of mad. I was mad that I had to get a blood test. I was mad that my mom had cancer. I was mad that she had to go through chemo. I was mad that I couldn’t go to the basketball game. I was mad that I had to wait so long to get the results. I was mad that I had to go to the hospital. I was mad that I had to get a shot. I was mad that I couldn’t see my mom. I was mad that my mom had cancer. I was mad that I didn’t know what to do. I was mad that I couldn’t talk to my friends. I was mad that my mom had cancer. I was mad that I had to wait for my mom to get better. I was mad that I couldn’t go to the mall. I was mad that I couldn’t go to the movies. I was mad that I couldn’t go to the park. I was mad that I couldn’t go to the store. I was mad that I had to wait so long. I was mad that I didn’t know
