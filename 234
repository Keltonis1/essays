A couple of years ago, I went to a game show called Jeopardy with my friends. We all sat in the audience, waiting for our turns to go on stage. I watched the game for a while and noticed a young man sitting on stage. He seemed to be having trouble with the questions, but he had such a big smile on his face that I couldn’t help but smile as well. When he was asked a question about the most populous country in Africa, he didn’t hesitate to give the correct answer, Nigeria. He looked around the audience and found me. I looked at him and gave him a thumbs up. He gave me a thumbs up and a big smile. Then, he went back to the game. I found out later that he had lost his sight to a disease called retinitis pigmentosa, but he was always happy. I realized that it doesn’t matter how much you see or don’t see, it’s what you do with what you have. I decided that day that I wanted to help people who were blind or visually impaired. I learned how to be an orientation and mobility specialist so that I could help people get around safely. I realized that it’s not about what you see, but what you do with what you have. I was given a great gift of sight, and I want to use it to help others who have lost their sight.
