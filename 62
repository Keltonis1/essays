The doctors gave her a week to live. For the next six days, I was a shadow in her hospital room. I couldn’t bring myself to leave her alone. When I wasn’t holding her hand, I was reading to her from her favorite books. She was my grandmother, and I didn’t want to lose her. Then, on the sixth day, she took her last breath. Her body was cold. The machines monitoring her heart rate were silent. I stood there, holding her hand. I couldn’t bring myself to let go. I didn’t want to lose her. I knew I had to, but I couldn’t. I felt guilty. I was supposed to be there for her, and I had failed. She had died alone, and I was too scared to say goodbye. I had let her down. I had let myself down. Then, the doctor came in and told me I had to let go. I reluctantly did so. I let go of her hand, and I walked out of the hospital room. I never went back. A few months later, I received a phone call. The hospital had lost my grandmother’s body. They wanted to know if I could help them find it. I couldn’t. I didn’t know where she was. I still don’t. A few months later, I was taking a stroll in the park with my mother. She was looking at me, trying to read my face. I was looking at her, trying to find something that would connect me to her. She was my grandmother, and I didn’t want to lose her. But I had. I still do.
