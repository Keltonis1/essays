The small building is not in a well-traveled part of town, so you would not have noticed it even if you were looking for it. However, the inconspicuousness of the building was made up for by the sounds that could be heard coming from within. When I was a freshman, I decided to drop by the center after school one day to meet a friend who was volunteering there. When I opened the door, I was surprised by the cacophony of sound that rushed out of the room. There were people of all ages and races, laughing, playing instruments, and singing. I was struck by the vibrant scene in front of me, so I walked in and introduced myself. I was met with warm smiles and open arms, and I felt as if I had just been welcomed into a family. It was then that I decided to become a regular at the center. There was a lot of music to learn, but it was worth it. I learned about all the different cultures represented in the center, and I made friends from all over the world. The center was a lot of fun, but there was also a lot of work to be done. We were responsible for taking care of all the instruments and teaching the songs. In the beginning, it was hard to teach a bunch of strangers the steps to a song. However, I quickly realized that music has the power to bring people together. Once the dance steps were learned, the group became more confident, and the smiles that we shared made it all worthwhile. The center was more than just a fun place to go; it was a place where I found something that I was good at. I found my voice. I am not a professional musician, but the center helped me find the confidence to express myself. It gave me the confidence to pursue my dream. The most important lesson that I learned at the center was that if you have a dream, you can achieve it. You just have to work hard
