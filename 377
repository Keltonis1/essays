I’ve always been an independent person. I never liked being told what to do, and I never liked asking for help. My grandma, however, is the complete opposite. She never learned how to drive, and she is terrified of riding in cars. She never learned how to use a computer or how to even send an email. She still has an old rotary phone that she uses to call people. It’s always been this way. Ever since I can remember, she’s been a very simple person. She doesn’t like to think of herself as stupid or old. She just doesn’t know how to do things that others take for granted. The more I grow up, the more I realize how ignorant I am. I didn’t even know how to make a cell phone call until I was fourteen years old. I am so used to having access to the internet, to knowing how to do things on my own, and to not needing anyone else to help me with things. I don’t like being in situations where I have to ask for help, or where I am at a disadvantage. I want to be able to do everything on my own, without the help of others. I want to be able to live my life and have the freedom to make my own decisions. But the more I grow up, the more I realize how ignorant I am.
