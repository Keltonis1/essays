The power of a name is an incredible thing. Names have the ability to inspire us, give us hope, and change the way we think about ourselves and the world. However, for many, the power of a name can also be an obstacle that restricts and even defines who we are. Growing up in the Korean community, my name was the first thing that made me stand out. When I was born, my parents wanted to name me “Chang Young”, but my father’s Americanized friends had a strong opinion against it.

The idea of changing my name was very foreign to me, as my name has been the same since birth. For the first five years of my life, I was called “Danny”, but I never really identified with the name. It wasn’t until I went to kindergarten that I discovered how others saw me. My name was the first thing people noticed about me, and it wasn’t because they thought I was a good student. “What’s your name?” they would ask. I remember having a hard time explaining to my classmates that I was not Chinese. As I grew older, I learned to adapt to my name and use it to my advantage. I started to take pride in my name, even though it was not my original name. I began to think of it as a symbol of my identity. When I began to play sports, I took on the name “Danny” and made it my own. I started to define myself by my name and my actions, and eventually, I started to forget about my real name. At the age of sixteen, I began to question the importance of names
