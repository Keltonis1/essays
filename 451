I used to be the girl who never let go of her grandmother’s hand. I would follow her around the neighborhood, and even on a trip to China, I stayed glued to her side. I loved her so much that I would jump into her arms when I saw her and would not let go until she asked me to. As I grew older, I realized that it was embarrassing to be so dependent on my grandmother, and I tried to stand on my own two feet. But when my grandmother got sick, I could not help but run to her side. I tried to be strong for my grandmother, but when I looked into her eyes, I knew that I could not leave her alone. She had always been there for me. My grandmother and I have a lot in common. We both like to watch TV, and we are both a little too obsessed with Korean dramas. My grandmother loves to cook and to clean, and so do I. We also love shopping and are often seen together on shopping trips. I remember when I was younger, I would get into trouble at school and would come home crying to my grandmother. My grandmother would hug me and tell me that everything was going to be okay. I would not want to leave her side, but she would gently tell me to go back to my room and finish my homework. That’s when I realized how much my grandmother loves me. My grandmother is my best friend, my confidante, and my biggest supporter. She is always there for me. I never want to let go of her hand. When I was little, I would not let go of my grandmother’s hand. Now that I am older, I realize that my grandmother needs me to hold her hand.
