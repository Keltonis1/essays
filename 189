A few months ago, my mother had a routine physical. As she was waiting in the doctor’s office, she decided to read the material posted on the wall. The doctor walked in and began to speak about her health. “Well, everything looks fine. Your cholesterol is a little high, but that is not uncommon for your age,” he said. “How is your blood pressure?” he asked. “Normal,” my mother replied. “Well, I would like to run a few tests,” the doctor said. “I want to make sure that your blood pressure is really normal.” He gave her some papers and asked her to go to the lab for some tests. She returned home and I asked her how the visit went. She said, “Well, everything is fine. The doctor ran a few tests to make sure that my blood pressure was really normal.” A few weeks later, my mom called me. She sounded very worried. She told me that the doctor had run some tests on her blood pressure and that it was high. She asked me to take her to the doctor for a follow-up visit. When we went to the doctor’s office, the doctor said that my mom needed to see a specialist. “I am going to refer you to a heart specialist,” he said. “We want to make sure that your blood pressure is really normal.” A few days later, my mom called me again. She sounded very worried. She told me that the heart specialist ran some tests on her blood pressure and that it was high. She asked me to take her to the doctor for a follow-up visit. When we went to the doctor’s office, the doctor said that my mom needed to see a cardiologist. “I am going to refer you to a cardiologist,” he said.
