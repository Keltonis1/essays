It was a dark night, but my flashlight cut through the mist and illuminated the steps ahead. I had hiked this trail many times, but the winter fog and looming trees always gave me the feeling of walking in a dream. The ethereal fog was an opaque wall that prevented me from seeing more than a few feet ahead. As I inched closer to the peak, I noticed a glow in the distance. It looked like a firefly at first, but then it grew larger and larger until I realized that it was a lighthouse. I climbed the final steps and walked towards the tower. The lighthouse was made of dark stone and seemed as ancient as the trees that surrounded it. As I entered the tower, the glow became brighter and illuminated the room. I walked up the winding staircase to the top of the tower and noticed a white tablet engraved with Chinese characters. It read, “You have reached the highest point of the Earth.” The fog was thicker here than anywhere else, but I could see for miles and miles. I felt like I could touch the sky, but I also felt as if I was being pulled towards the ground. I felt so small, but so immense. The mist gave me a sense of safety and serenity, but it also gave me a sense of isolation and emptiness. It was a sense of fulfillment and longing. I could see the Earth from above and look down on the people I loved, but I also knew that I was alone. I knew that I would never have that sense of peace again. The only thing that kept me going was the thought that I would see my loved ones again. I would tell them how much I love them. I would tell them how proud I am of them. I would tell them how they make me feel safe and secure. I would tell them how they make me feel like I can accomplish anything. I would tell them how much I miss them when I’m not around them
