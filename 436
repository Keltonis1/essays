We were there in the beginning. The march into the city, the first shots fired, the first deaths, the glory of victory. We were there in the end. We fought at the bitter end, the last ditch effort, the final push, the last stand. We were there to see the new regime rise, and we were there when it fell. We loved, we fought, we cried, we died, we are there yet. We are the veterans of the American Civil War. When I was fourteen, I was a Civil War reenactor. I did it for the love of the game, for the respect of the men who had fought in the war, and for the thrill of the fight. I was just like the men I played. I was dedicated to my cause and ready to give my life for it. I was a Union officer in a Confederate camp. I was a Confederate officer in a Union camp. I was a doctor, a soldier, a farmer, a hunter, a pilot, and a businessman. I was a man. I was a child. I was a boy. I was a Civil War reenactor. I was a child who had the honor of playing in the woods with his father, and I was a man who had the honor of playing in the woods with his father. The game was fun, and the game was beautiful. It was a great game, and I loved it. I loved my fellow reenactors and their passion for the game. I loved that we were there to see the new regime rise and fall. I loved that we were there in the end. To me, the game was real and the men were real. We were there in the beginning, we fought at the bitter end, we cried, we died, we are there yet. I loved them, and I am still there.
