The opening bell was barely audible above the chaotic din of excited chatter and loud thumping footsteps. I made my way to the locker room, fumbled with my combination lock, and finally got in to see a sea of similar-looking, overly-stressed freshmen. I didn’t feel the same as the others. I was different. In that moment, I realized that I was the only girl on the team. When I started playing football in seventh grade, I never thought I would become a girl playing on a boys’ team. When I first started, I just wanted to play. I wanted to feel like everyone else. I had a small part in a much bigger picture. It was a big decision to leave my old team. When I was young, I never thought that I would play football for a team that wasn’t for girls. As I began to walk up to the field, I realized how big a mistake I had made. All I could hear was the word “girl” being chanted from the stands. I couldn’t take it anymore. I just wanted to stop playing. But when I turned around, I saw my mom smiling at me. That smile gave me the courage to keep going. I realized that I was playing for myself, my family, and my future. My mom always told me to do my best. It was my chance to prove that I could do what I wanted to do. As I started to play, I began to realize that the boys were surprised at how well I played. They even said that I was “all right”. It felt good to be recognized as an equal. It felt good to play the sport I love with the boys. I have always been different. I have always been the only girl. But that doesn’t mean I have to be the only girl who plays football.
