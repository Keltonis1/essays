“What do you want to be when you grow up?” is a question I have been asked my whole life. For most of my life, I have had an answer. I have always known I wanted to be a doctor, like my mother and my sister. It is not that I never had any other ideas. I wanted to be a racecar driver, a cowboy, and an astronaut. However, none of these other ideas ever lasted very long. I have always wanted to be a doctor. It is a career I have known I would pursue since I was a little boy. I’m not sure why I have always known this, but I do. Perhaps it was my mother’s influence. Perhaps it was my father’s drive to help others. I’m not sure. I am sure of one thing, though. I am now in the position to choose my career. I can be a doctor. I can be anything I want to be. But I am not sure I want to be a doctor anymore. I think I want to be a writer. I want to write stories and make people think. I want to write about the things that are wrong in the world and tell people that it is okay to be themselves. I want to write about the things that are right in the world and tell people that it is okay to love themselves. I want to write about the things that make me feel, and I want to make people feel. I want to make people think. I want to make people think about the world and what they are doing to it. I want to make people think about the people around them and what they are doing to them. I want to make people think about themselves and what they are doing to themselves. I want to write. I want to make people feel. I want to make people think. I want to make people think about what they are doing to the world and the people
