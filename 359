There is nothing more beautiful than the sunset. As the day fades into the darkness of night, the vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows of the sky reflect on the surface of the lake. As I sit on the rocks that jut out into the water, I imagine how it would feel to jump into the air and float to the surface, just like the leaves on the surface of the lake. The sun has set and it is now dark, but the moon is a few days from being full. Its soft glow illuminates the surface of the lake and I can see the leaves that float on the water. A cold breeze sends the leaves and small ripples across the lake. As the leaves and ripples glide across the surface, I imagine the sound that they would make. I hear the leaves swish as they are pushed across the surface of the water. I hear the water splashing as the leaves fall onto it. I hear the wind blowing in the distance. I hear a rustling in the trees behind me. I hear a gentle whispering in the air around me. I hear the sound of the world.
