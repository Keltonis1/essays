On December 6, 2012, the day my grandma passed away, I was sitting in my living room listening to the rain. The only thing I remember hearing was the soft thud of the raindrops hitting the glass of my windows. I was staring at the droplets, mesmerized by the way they slid down the window, and suddenly, my mind was flooded with memories of my grandma. My mom had been calling me, but I didn’t hear her. When I finally looked up, she was standing in front of me. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. My grandma had died. I ran to my room and collapsed onto my bed, sobbing into my pillow. I didn’t understand why this had happened. She had seemed fine when I had seen her two days before. I kept asking myself why she had to die. When I finally calmed down, I looked up at my wall. It was covered with pictures of my family and me, my friends, my sports teams, my artwork. I remembered that my grandma had always told me that I should never let go of the people I love. She said that one day, when I was old, I would look back on all of these pictures and remember my loved ones. And she was right. These pictures are what bring back all of the memories of my grandma. It’s what makes me smile and it’s what makes me cry. It’s what reminds me that I’ll always have her. My grandma was an amazing person. She was very loving and caring. She was always there for me, whether it was helping me with homework, giving me advice, or just listening to me when I needed someone to talk to. I will never forget the last thing she said to me: “Be a good girl.” I’ll never forget my grandma. I’ll never forget how much she loved me.
