Every night, my grandmother slept next to the TV, waking up every time the characters spoke or the sound effects played. “Don’t forget to turn off the TV,” my mother would remind her before she left for work. But every morning, she would discover that my grandmother had forgotten to turn off the TV, and it would be left on all night. “Did you turn off the TV last night?” my mother would ask. “Oh, it’s on? I thought it was off,” my grandmother would say. In the beginning, my grandmother would turn off the TV by herself, but as her dementia progressed, she would forget, and my mother would have to remind her. This routine would repeat itself for months, until one day, my mother came home to discover that the TV was on, and my grandmother was asleep next to it. My mother shook her awake. “Did you turn off the TV?” she asked. “I thought it was off,” my grandmother replied. “Did you turn it off last night?” my mother asked. “Oh, I thought it was off,” my grandmother said. My mother turned off the TV, and she knew that it would be on again the next night. The cycle of forgetfulness continued until one day, my mother came home to find that the TV was off. She asked my grandmother, “Did you turn off the TV?” “Yes,” my grandmother said. “I turned it off.” And so my grandmother slept next to an off TV, and my mother slept next to an off TV.
