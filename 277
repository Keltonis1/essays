One day I will be too weak to climb the stairs, and the person who helps me will be my child. This is my only daughter, her name is Delilah. Delilah and I used to have many things in common. We both loved to dance and play piano, and we both played on the same soccer team. But the older Delilah gets, the more she is growing apart from me. We both love the same things, but we have different ways of showing it. Delilah has become much more independent, and I’ve become more dependent. My dad was my hero. He was the first person to walk me down the aisle at my wedding. When I was a little girl, I would wait for him to come home from work and tell him all about my day. He was always so proud of me. One of my favorite memories is of my dad taking me to the park and pushing me on the swings. I loved the feeling of flying through the air. I know that Delilah and I will never have the same relationship that I had with my dad. I’m going to have to accept that I’m going to need help raising my daughter. I hope that Delilah and I will still be close. But I’m afraid that one day, I’ll need to ask for her help. Delilah and I have always been so close, and I’m afraid that the distance between us will grow. I want her to remember the days when we were both little girls who loved to play and laugh. I want her to remember that I always tried to be the best mother I could be. And I want her to know that I’m proud of her, and that I love her more than she could ever imagine.
