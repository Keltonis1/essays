My grandparents have always been the epitome of health to me. My grandmother has never been sick, let alone in the hospital. She has been to the doctor twice in her life: once to get her tonsils removed, and once to get her appendix removed. My grandfather, on the other hand, has been to the hospital for a hernia operation and to get a cyst removed. When my grandparents reached their seventies, my grandmother had to start seeing a doctor for regular checkups. When she turned eighty, she went to the doctor because she had fallen and hurt her hip.

It was a small fracture, and the doctor said that she could get it fixed by a simple surgery, or she could let it heal on its own. She decided to let it heal on its own, and after a couple of months, she was back to normal. A few months after she had the surgery, my grandmother went to her doctor’s appointment. She had some tests done and it turned out that she had cancer. She had a tumor the size of a golf ball on her liver. The doctors said that it was cancerous and they wanted to operate immediately. It was only a few months after her hip surgery, and she was in the hospital for a few days. She had a successful surgery, and after a few months, she was back to normal.
