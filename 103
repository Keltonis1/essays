It was a cold night in late October, the night before my grandmother’s birthday. She had been sick for a few days. I was so happy that she was finally going to be able to celebrate her birthday with us. I was really excited. When we arrived at the hospital, we saw a sign in the hallway that read, “Welcome to the ICU.” We didn’t know what it meant. When we got to the door, we found out that it was the intensive care unit. We didn’t know what that meant either. We walked in the door, and there was a nurse there. We said, “We’re here to see Mrs. Thomas.” The nurse asked us to sign some papers. I signed my name, but my mom couldn’t sign hers. She was crying so hard, she couldn’t see the paper. I had never seen my mom cry before. I was very scared. Then we walked down the hallway to a room where there was a lady waiting for us. She said, “Hello, I’m Dr. Thomas. I’m Mrs. Thomas’s daughter.” She told us that my grandmother had a stroke. She couldn’t talk. She couldn’t eat. She couldn’t even move her fingers. I was very sad. The doctor asked us if we wanted to see my grandmother. I said, “Yes, please.” When we walked into the room, I saw my grandmother lying in the bed. She was so skinny. She had wires all over her head. She was so still. She was wearing a beautiful nightgown. She looked so peaceful. I wanted to kiss her and hug her. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t even touch her. I just looked at her. I could tell that she was really happy
