When I was born, my mom was twenty-one. I was her first child. As she described it, “The hospital staff took me away from her and put me in the incubator. She was heartbroken.” The doctors had told her that I had a hole in my heart. For three months, she visited me every day. But then she began to miss classes, and eventually, she dropped out of school. She couldn’t afford to take care of me and go to school. So she decided to give me up. “I never even got to hold you,” she told me. I was adopted by a family that was older than my biological parents. I was lucky to have two brothers who were ten and seven years older than me. I had a new mom, dad, and brother, but I was also given a new name. The first thing I remember about my new family was how much I was loved. My mom would hug me so tight that I could barely breathe. My dad would always be playing with me. And my brother would make sure I was always doing well in school. “Why didn’t my mom want me?” I asked my dad. “I’m sure she had a good reason,” he replied. “Maybe she was too young.” I was young too, I thought. My mom was only sixteen. Maybe that’s why she gave me up. “Why did I have to be adopted?” I asked. “It’s a miracle,” my dad said. “You were given a second chance.” He was right. My new family was everything that I had always wanted. But there was one thing that I couldn’t understand. I was different from my brothers. I was always sick, and I was always tired. I was constantly going to the doctor
