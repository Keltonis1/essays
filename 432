The hospital room is white; the bed is white. The pillow is white. Even the man in the hospital bed is white, save for his blackened toes. I am sitting in a white chair, staring at the white windows. The entire world is white. I watch the sunlight make its way through the window, eventually reaching the man. He is lying down, not moving. There is a tube in his nose and an IV in his arm. He is dying. I am sitting in a hospital room, watching a man die. The man’s name is Jorge. He is my father. The doctor had warned me that he was dying. But somehow, I was unable to comprehend what that meant. I could not imagine my father not living; I could not imagine my father’s face as it would be without life. I could not imagine a world without my father. My father is my world. My father is my hero. My father is my best friend. I have never been without him. I have never had to. Because he is always there. My father keeps me safe. My father keeps me warm. My father is my everything. But now, my father is dying. And I want to cry. I want to scream. I want to run out the door and never come back. But I can’t. I have to stay. I have to watch. I am sitting in a hospital room, watching a man die. I sit in the chair and I stare at the white windows. They are not looking back. The sunlight is fading and the shadows are growing. I can no longer see the sunlight, but I can still see the shadows. And they are growing. I am sitting in a hospital room, watching the shadows grow. They are reaching out, grasping him. They are holding him tight, not letting him go. The sunlight is gone, but the shadows are still there. They are holding on to him.
