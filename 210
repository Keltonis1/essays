It was the worst day of my life. I had never seen my father so angry. He was pacing around the living room, shouting about how I’d ruined his life. As he spoke, I could feel the blood drain from my face. I could hear my heart pounding in my ears. I could feel the tears begin to well up in my eyes. It wasn’t the first time my father had yelled at me. But it was the first time he’d ever told me that he hated me. I had never seen him so angry before. I couldn’t understand what I had done wrong. I was the one who had always looked out for him. I was the one who always listened to his problems. I was the one who always made sure that he was happy. I couldn’t believe that I had disappointed him so much. I didn’t understand why he hated me so much. I thought he was supposed to love me. I was only seven years old. But at that moment, I hated him too. As I lay in my bed that night, I could feel the hot tears streaming down my face. I could feel the lump in my throat. I could feel the pain in my chest. I couldn’t understand why my father hated me. I was just a little girl. I was only seven years old. But at that moment, I hated him too. I hated him for telling me that he hated me. I hated him for hurting me. I hated him for telling me that I had ruined his life. I hated him for saying that he didn’t love me anymore. I hated him for making me cry. I hated him for making me feel so bad. I was only seven years old. But at that moment, I hated him too.
