My father, a PhD in Physics, has always been my role model. He is a man of science, a man of reason, a man of logic, a man of rationality. He has spent most of his life trying to understand the way the world works, and to explain this to others. Science is not about making the most money, nor about fame, nor about the highest status.

Instead, I learned that the world was chaotic, unpredictable, and full of uncertainty. I learned that science did not offer all the answers to life’s questions. I learned that science, like any other discipline, was limited to the knowledge that we had accumulated up until that point.

I learned that I didn’t have to choose between the two. I learned that science was not about being rational. I learned that science was not about being logical. I learned that science was about being curious. I learned that science was about
