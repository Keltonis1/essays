The first time I heard the word “cancer” was in the summer of my freshman year in high school. It was the first day of my internship, and I was listening to the doctors speak to my class about what would be our future jobs. There were about forty students in the class, and it was one of those rare moments when everyone was really paying attention. The doctors proceeded to give a brief introduction about the hospital’s history and its specialties, and then the speaker introduced our hospital’s most renowned specialist in the field of oncology. He was known for his groundbreaking research in finding remedies for cancer, and he had specific interest in finding a cure for breast cancer. My classmates were listening eagerly, for this was the most spectacular part of the internship. But as he continued to talk about breast cancer, I began to zone out. I could not concentrate on his words anymore because I had just been given the most horrible information, and I could not fathom the idea of having cancer. The doctors meant well, but the way they had presented the information was far too upsetting and, frankly, overwhelming for me. I felt that my life had been suddenly turned upside down, and I wanted to scream for the doctors to stop talking. I did not want to hear the name “cancer” again because I was afraid that it would show up in my medical records someday, and that the name “cancer” would forever be associated with me. I did not want to be associated with the word “cancer.” Yet, I did not talk to anyone about it; I just tried to re-absorb the information so that I would not have to think about it anymore. In the following weeks, I had to go through a lot of tests for breast cancer, and the doctors were constantly reminding me that I might have cancer. I was haunted by the possibility that I would have cancer for the rest of my life
