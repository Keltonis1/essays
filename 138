My grandmother hosted her first Thanksgiving dinner when I was in third grade. I remember telling my mom that I thought my grandmother was going to die. As I sat at the dinner table, I could not believe how much her hands shook as she tried to cut the turkey. I was scared for her. My dad and I tried to help her, but she insisted that she could do it. She was trying so hard to be strong. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s less than a year before, and she was determined to not let the disease get the best of her. She was a strong woman. Alzheimer’s has been a part of my family for as long as I can remember. My mom’s mom died from the disease, and my dad’s sister was recently diagnosed. I have seen the effects that Alzheimer’s can have on a family, and I have seen the strength that members of my family have shown in the face of this disease. My grandma may no longer be able to cut the turkey, but she is still my grandma. And I love her. Alzheimer’s has taken away many of the things that my grandma used to do. But it hasn’t taken away her love for us, and it hasn’t taken away my love for her.
