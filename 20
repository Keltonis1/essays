"In her left hand, she clutches a paper bag. It is wrinkled, with the letters "USA" scrawled across the front. In her right hand, she clutches a plastic bag. It is wrinkled, with the letters "USA" scrawled across the front. She wears a purple hat. It is not her favorite color. The wind howls, cold and biting. Her heart pounds, not knowing where she is. A few weeks ago, she was living with her mother in a small village in Myanmar. Her name is Khin. Her eyes are wide with fear. She is a refugee. She steps into the dimly lit warehouse, lit only by fluorescent lights hanging from the ceiling. A man stands behind a counter. He is not her father. She is a slave. She gives the man the bags. He gives her a small piece of paper. She takes the paper and hands it to the woman standing next to her. She speaks her language, but Khin cannot understand her. The woman points to a room. Khin follows her into the room. The room is dark. The woman leaves her alone. She sits down. She waits. The sun sets. She hears people walking in the room. The lights turn on. She sees children her age. They speak a different language. She speaks a different language. She sees a group of people speaking her language. They tell her she will go to school. She cries. She is not going to school. She is a slave. She is going to work. She is a slave. She is going to work in the fields. She is a slave. She is going to work in the fields for many hours every day. She is a slave. She is not going to go to school. She is a slave. She is a slave. She is a slave. She is a slave."
