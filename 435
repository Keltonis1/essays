My mother left Korea in her early twenties. She was the first of her siblings to immigrate to the United States and later brought her husband and my sister. While my father and sister quickly assimilated into American culture, my mother struggled to adapt to the foreign language and unfamiliar customs. To ease the transition, my mother worked hard to learn English, even while holding down a full-time job. I remember her putting on her earphones and walking to the grocery store to practice her English with the cashiers and salespeople. After my father and sister settled in, my mother began to take college courses at night. She was the first person in her family to get a college degree. As I grew up, I watched my mother, a woman with little formal education, take care of her family, friends, and her church, and raise two kids. The story of my mother’s life inspires me to strive to be a selfless person who can give back to my community. As a teenager, I had the chance to travel with my family to Korea. My mom’s family was very traditional, so I had a lot of pressure to succeed in school and in life. I had trouble coping with the intense academic pressure. My uncle, who is my mother’s younger brother, was also in Korea. Unlike my mother, he had no interest in studying or working hard in school. He was always out partying and drinking with his friends. My uncle is not the best example of what a person should be. He was a high school dropout who went to prison for petty crimes. But I remember him telling me a story that has stuck with me. He said that he had never studied hard in school, and he regretted it. When he was young, he wanted to be a professional basketball player, but he lacked the skills and work ethic. He explained to me that if he had tried harder in school, he could have been a better player.
