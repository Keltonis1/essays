I tried to run as fast as I could; there were still a few minutes before my bus came. But my backpack weighed me down, and the bag of groceries in my hand seemed to multiply in weight. I could hear my heart pounding as I tried to run faster. I was almost there. I could see the bus waiting for me, I could see the driver leaning against the windshield. The next few seconds were a blur. I could hear my name being called, and I could see people rushing toward me. I fell to the ground, and the world seemed to fall silent. Suddenly, I could hear the bus engine again, and I could see the driver get back into his seat. I looked around me, wondering what had happened. I had missed the bus. I had become so focused on running that I did not realize that I had hit a patch of ice and skidded across the ground. I looked at my hands, expecting to find blood. I saw my backpack, which had saved me from serious injury. It had protected me as I fell to the ground. I looked at the groceries, which had spilled out of my bag and were scattered across the ground. I looked up and saw my father walking toward me. He helped me up and told me that he had called the bus to wait for me. I thought about how lucky I was. At first, I was mad at myself for missing the bus. I had wanted to go to the grocery store, but I had become so distracted that I was almost late for the bus. I had almost missed this chance to have my fatherâ€™s help. I had almost missed this chance to grow closer to my father. I had almost missed this chance to learn from my mistake. I had almost missed this chance to have more time with my father. I had almost missed this chance to have my father help me. I had almost missed this chance to have an opportunity to grow closer to my father.
