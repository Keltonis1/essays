As I sit in the hospital room and watch my grandma sleep, I can’t help but think of how we’ve grown apart. She used to be my hero, my inspiration. I used to think that if I studied hard, I would be as smart as she is. When I was a kid, she would help me with my homework and tell me to be strong. She would say that she knew I could do it because I was her grandson. As I grew older, I stopped listening to her. She was my grandma, not my mother, and I was getting older and knew more than she did. She always tried to help me, but I didn’t want to listen. It was easier for me to just do it myself. I could get my homework done faster that way. I didn’t have to hear her say that she was proud of me or that I was her hero. I didn’t want to hear that she knew I could do it because I was her grandson. I was tired of hearing that. I was tired of being compared to her. I didn’t want to hear that I could do anything because she had already done it. I stopped listening to her. When I look at her now, I realize that I never listened to her. She’s sick and doesn’t remember me. I’m sick and don’t remember her. I used to think that if I studied hard, I would be as smart as she is. I’m sitting here in the hospital room, looking at her and thinking, I should have listened to her.
