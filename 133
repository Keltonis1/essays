My grandmother, Luz, is the most important person in my life. I grew up calling her “Lala” (grandma in Filipino), and I was raised by her and my parents, in an immigrant community in San Francisco. When I was a little boy, I would spend a lot of time with her. I remember that I would always be holding her hand, following her around the house. I was probably around four or five years old. She would read to me, and would help me with my homework. I always felt that I could tell her anything. She was always so kind and loving. In fact, I still do. I remember when I was young, I would come home from school and ask her, “Lala, what is love?” She would tell me that love is when you take care of somebody else. She would then take my hand and we would walk around the house, and she would show me how to do the dishes, or how to make a bed. I loved her so much. As I grew older, I wanted to be more independent. I wanted to learn how to do things on my own. I remember, I used to go to my dad’s room and ask him, “Dad, what is love?” He would say, “Son, that’s a difficult question to answer.” He would then say, “Love is when you care about someone.” My dad would take me to the garage and teach me how to change a flat tire. He would take me to the store and teach me how to make change. I remember that I would tell him, “Dad, I don’t want to go to the garage, I want to play with my friends.” I remember that he would tell me, “Son, you need to learn these things. You need to be prepared for the future.
