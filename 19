I first met Celine when I was sixteen. She was the daughter of a family friend who had come to visit from France. At the time, I was living in a small town in the southwest corner of France. It was a quaint village where everyone knew everyone else, and the pace of life was slow. Celine, on the other hand, was used to the hustle and bustle of Paris, and she often found herself missing home. I was fascinated by this young girl who seemed to be so worldly and yet so innocent at the same time. It was as if I had discovered a secret world. At first, I found myself questioning whether she was real. It was almost like I had walked into a fairy tale and found a princess. And I was in love. I quickly began to spend all my free time with Celine. She and I would go for long walks through the country roads, and weâ€™d sit on the banks of the local river and talk for hours. It was there that I learned about her family, her culture, and her language. I even learned to speak a few words of French. She was a great friend and a great teacher. As time went on, we became inseparable. I loved her for her innocence and her warmth, and I felt that I had found my soul mate. The day she left was the saddest day of my life. She went back to Paris, and I returned to school in Paris. It was hard to be so far away from the one I loved, and I was sure that I would never see her again. However, I was lucky enough to be able to return to my hometown during the holidays. One night, I went to a dance at a local country club, and as I entered the room, I spotted Celine in the crowd. I quickly walked over to her and asked if she would dance with me. She accepted my invitation, and we spent the entire night together
