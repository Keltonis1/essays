One morning, when I was a little girl, I woke up and heard a noise coming from the kitchen. As I got up, I realized that the noise was coming from the fridge. When I opened it, I found a tiny kitten, mewing and shivering. I couldn’t believe my eyes. What a beautiful little creature. I picked him up, carried him to my room, and brought him inside my toy box. After that, I took care of him, and my family accepted him as one of us. When I grew up, I decided to go to college to study veterinary medicine, and I always hoped to have a pet clinic. After graduation, I found a job at a clinic. I was really happy, because I could help all the animals I loved. However, one day, I got a call from the shelter. A homeless man had found a puppy on the street and was bringing him in for treatment. When I got to the shelter, I was shocked to see that the puppy was the same kitten I had rescued from the fridge when I was little. The man had found him, starving and alone, wandering around the city. The veterinarian said that the puppy was only two months old and that he had not been cared for. I brought the puppy back to the clinic and took care of him for two weeks. When I was sure that he was well, I brought him home. That day, I told my mom that I had a new family member. She was so happy, because I was always by myself, and my mom was lonely. She said that the puppy was very cute and that he would be a good friend for me. After a year, I graduated from college. I was ready to start my dream job. When I got to the clinic, I found a sign saying, “We’re moving to a new location. Please call this number for more information.” I was really disappointed,
