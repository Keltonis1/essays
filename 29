My grandmother is not your typical grandmother. She is very young and full of energy. I love her very much. When I was born, she would bring me to her work, where she was a physical therapist. She was in the best physical shape of her life. She would always do her exercises, lift weights, and run on the treadmill. Then one day, she tripped on the treadmill and had a heart attack. Her doctor said that it was from overworking. She had to stop working. It broke her heart. She stopped going to the gym and she started to gain weight. Then one day, my grandma and I were playing outside and she fell. She broke her leg. I remember it was really cold and it was snowing. She was in so much pain. I was so worried. I remember that the doctor had to put a cast on her leg. I was so scared. I didn’t want my grandma to be in pain. I knew that it was hard for her to walk with a cast on her leg. I felt so sorry for her. When I came back from school, she would always be in bed. She had to stay in bed all day. She had a lot of pain. I was really sad. I didn’t want her to feel so bad. I wanted her to get better. My mom told me that she was going to be okay. My mom said that I needed to help her. I felt really guilty because I didn’t help her. I knew that she needed me. I promised myself that I would help her get better. I told my mom that I wanted to help her. My mom said that I could help her by doing the laundry, cleaning, and helping her cook. I was really excited to help her. My grandma would always be in bed, so I would take her blanket and lay it on the floor. Then I would take her remote control and put it on
