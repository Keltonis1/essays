Before I was born, my parents moved to the United States from Korea. They had both been artists and wanted to continue their work. The government did not support artists, but in America they believed they could find their own way and live a life of their own choosing. My father found a job as a chef, and my mother as a waitress. But they still struggled to make ends meet. My mother remembers the first time I was allowed to go to the grocery store with her. I was four years old, and I was so excited to help her pick out the food I would eat. I remember that my mother told me to pick out the vegetables and fruits. At first, I was confused because I thought vegetables and fruits were the same thing. She laughed and told me that fruits are the sweet, juicy things with peels on them. I felt embarrassed, but also happy that she let me help her and trust me. My parents tried to give me a good life in America. My dad would wake up at 5 AM and go to work at the restaurant, and my mom would get up at 6 AM to go to work. I would always get up early to help them. I would fix my own breakfast while they were getting ready to leave and then I would get ready to go to school. After school, I would help my mom clean the house and cook dinner, and then I would help my dad clean up at the restaurant and get ready for bed. My parents always worked hard so that I could have a better life. They sacrificed and worked long hours so that I would have a good education and a bright future. I knew they loved me and they were proud of me because they always told me that I was the best son and that they loved me more than anything. I remember the day my parents told me that I was going to be a big brother. I was so excited! I wanted to play with my new baby brother. I wanted to protect him
