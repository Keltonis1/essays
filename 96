I wake up every morning and look into the mirror. My reflection is always the same: a skinny boy with an oversized head and brown hair that’s not quite long enough to cover his eyes. It doesn’t look like me. My hair has always been the same shade of brown, but it used to be a lot shorter. And I used to be a lot taller. I still don’t look like my old self. Every morning, I wake up, look in the mirror, and wish I could go back in time and change what happened. My name is Michael. I’m fourteen years old. I’m a freshman at New York Academy. I’ve been living in New York City for almost my entire life. But it wasn’t always that way. I used to live in upstate New York, in a little town called Onondaga. It’s about a three-hour drive from New York City. I used to live there with my parents, my sister, and my grandparents. I used to have a normal life, but everything changed when my family moved to New York City. It was a sunny, summer day. We were sitting around the kitchen table eating lunch when my mom came home from work. She looked at my dad and said, “We’re moving to New York City.” “What?” I asked. “Why?” “Because,” my mom replied, “I got a new job.” “What about me?” I asked. “I’m going to a new school,” I said. “What about my friends?” “We’ll have to leave them behind,” my mom said. “But why?” I asked. “It’s not fair!” I remember crying.
