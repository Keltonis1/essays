The first time I realized my grandmother was sick was when I noticed that she wasn’t sleeping. Even when my family and I would return from the hustle and bustle of Seoul, South Korea, where we lived, my grandmother would never sleep at night. I’d watch her in the dark, her eyes wide open, her body motionless, and her face expressionless. My grandmother was never one to be silent, even at night. She’d often tell me stories of her childhood, or play with my toys with me. I’d watch her in the dark and wonder why she was never sleeping. It was my grandfather who first told me that my grandmother had cancer. I remember it vividly. I was only four years old. I had just woken up from a nap when I noticed my grandfather in the kitchen with my mother. “What’s going on?” I asked my mother. She replied, “Your grandmother has cancer.” I didn’t understand what that meant, but it sounded serious. I was confused, scared, and sad. I asked her what cancer was, but she didn’t know how to explain it to me. I remember sitting in the kitchen, looking out the window, and crying. I had just learned that my grandmother was sick. And she was going to die. That’s what my mother told me. I didn’t want to believe her. I wanted to run up to my grandmother’s room and ask her why she was sleeping all the time. I wanted to hear her stories. I wanted to play with her. But I didn’t want her to die. I remember asking my mother, “Will she be okay?” My mother didn’t know what to say. “No, she won’t,” she replied. I remember going up to my grandmother
