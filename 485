We were all having a great time at the party until he said it. I was standing around, talking to people, and then he walked up to me and said it. "Are you a lesbian?" I was taken aback. I hadn't expected it. I didn't know what to say. I just stood there, stunned, and then people started gathering around and they started questioning me. "Does it bother you that he said that?" they asked. "How do you feel about it?" "Why are you so quiet?" I hadn't expected it. I didn't know what to say. I just stood there, stunned, and then people started gathering around and they started questioning me. "Does it bother you that he said that?" they asked. "How do you feel about it?" "Why are you so quiet?" The truth is, I didn't know how to feel. It was a shock. I had never been openly asked that question before. It's not like I'm out telling everyone I'm a lesbian all the time. I've never had to. I was born this way. I thought that everyone could sense that about me. I wasn't expecting it. I didn't know how to react. I didn't know how to feel. I was just standing there. I just stood there, stunned, and then people started gathering around and they started questioning me. "Does it bother you that he said that?" they asked. "How do you feel about it?" "Why are you so quiet?" I had to get out of there. I had to get away. I didn't know how to feel.
