It was Christmas Eve, and I was looking forward to seeing my family the next day. I was very excited to go home and see my younger sister. She was born a year after I was, and we had always been close. We shared a room together, and we always did everything together. She was my best friend. But on the day before Christmas, I was told that she had cancer. The doctor said that it was only a matter of time. I was shocked. She was just a kid, just a baby! I felt very sad. My family had no idea how to tell me. I knew that I was going to die soon. My sister had cancer, and she was going to die. I could feel it in my bones. I was a little bit scared. But mostly, I was sad. The next day, my sister was very sick. I had to stay in my room. But I could hear her screaming. It was the worst sound I had ever heard. It was like she was in pain. I cried a lot that day. It was the worst day of my life. When my sister died, I was very sad. She was my best friend. I was very scared. I felt like I had lost my best friend. My sister died a few days later. It was very sad. My family cried a lot. I did too. I missed her a lot. I will never forget my sister. She was my best friend. I will never forget her.
