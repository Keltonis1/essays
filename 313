We walked in silence. It was a quiet and peaceful walk. It was like every other day. We always went on walks. It was a ritual that I loved. The fresh air and green trees that surrounded us were refreshing and they made me feel like a child again. I was always the first to speak. “Dad,” I asked. “How are you?” “I’m fine,” he answered. “How about you?” “I’m fine too,” I replied. We talked about the usual things we talked about on our walks. We talked about the weather, the trees, and the dogs that ran past us. It was peaceful. We walked for a few more minutes until we got to the park. I took a seat on a bench. Dad sat next to me. I looked at him. He was old. His hair was white. His hands were wrinkled. He was old. Dad looked at me. “Son,” he said. “I want to tell you something.” “Okay,” I replied. “What is it?” “I’m dying,” he said. “What?” I said. “You’re kidding, right?” “No,” he said. “I’m not. I’m dying. I have cancer.” “Oh my God,” I said. “I didn’t know.” “I didn’t want you to know,” he said. “I didn’t want you to worry.” “I’m so sorry,” I said. “I’m so sorry.” “It’s okay,” he said.
