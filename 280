I am not a “perfect” child. I am not the “perfect” student. I am not the “perfect” son. And I am definitely not the “perfect” daughter. But my parents are not “perfect” parents. My dad is not “perfect” dad. My mom is not “perfect” mom. But I love them. I love them both, for they are the reason why I exist today. I am not a “perfect” child. But I am not “perfect” because I was born with a genetic disease that has kept me from reaching my full potential. When I was a baby, my parents found out that I had a chromosomal abnormality that resulted in me having intellectual disability. It was so severe that doctors told my parents that I would never be able to walk or talk. I was supposed to have a “normal” life of being unable to learn, unable to do anything. I was supposed to be “useless”. But my parents refused to listen to the doctors. My parents wanted me to be a child like any other. They wanted me to be able to walk and talk. So they spent countless hours trying to get me to crawl, and countless more hours trying to get me to say a single word. My parents’ persistence paid off. I started to crawl, and then walk. I started to talk, and then communicate. I started to learn, and then understand. But most importantly, I started to live. I am not a “perfect” student. But I am not “perfect” because I have never learned to read. When I was in first grade, I started to receive tutoring. I started to learn how to read. I did not like it. I hated it. I was frustrated. I wanted to learn. I wanted to learn to read.
