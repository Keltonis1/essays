My name is Jonathan M., and I am a freshman at Harker. I am a pianist, a music student, a pianist-music student. I am also the son of an architect and a psychiatrist, and the brother of a pediatrician and a neuroscientist. My parents are smart people. I am the youngest of four children. My family is smart, and I am proud of it. I don’t know if I am smart. When I was in middle school, I was average. My grades were not good, but they were not bad. I was a pretty normal kid, and I felt like an average student. My parents were not satisfied with my performance. I didn’t care, and I told them that I didn’t care. I was fine with being average, and I wanted to stay that way. But I wasn’t fine. I was miserable. I didn’t want to be average, but I didn’t know how to get better. I felt like a failure. My parents wanted me to be smart, and I felt like I was letting them down. I felt like I was letting myself down. I felt like I was a loser. When I was in high school, I started to do better. I didn’t get great grades, but they were good enough. I took the hardest classes that I could, and I started to work harder. I became a better student. I felt better about myself. I was still average, but I was better. I worked hard enough to get the grades I needed to get into a good college. I worked hard enough to get into Harker. I was excited to come here, and I was happy that I was able to get in. But when I got here, I felt average again. The work is harder, the teachers are tougher, and the other students are smarter. I feel like I am back
