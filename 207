The time of day when I met the man in the black suit was one of the last I had with my grandfather. He was always a man of many stories, but after his stroke in 2002, his memory had started to fade. One day, I walked into his room and found him sitting by the window, watching the traffic pass by. I walked up to him and asked him what he was doing. He looked at me, but said nothing. Then I realized he couldn’t remember my name. That was when I realized that his memory had gone, and I could no longer talk to him about his stories. His condition worsened. One day, I found him sitting in his chair, staring out the window. He didn’t even notice me. He was lost in his own world. His once proud and strong face was pale and sickly. He looked frail and old. I felt helpless and wanted to say something to him, but I didn’t know what to say. I just sat there and stared at him. He looked up at me and smiled, then he slowly closed his eyes. He was gone. I had always thought he was a kind and loving grandfather. He was the one who told me stories about his life, taught me to play chess, and taught me how to drive. He was a hard worker and he loved his family. I will never forget the stories he told me about the war, his life in Korea, and the day he arrived in America. I remember his face as I looked at him in his final moments. I will never forget the look on his face. It will always be in my memory. He was no longer there. It was like he was a distant memory of the past. He was no longer a part of my life. I felt lost and empty without him. I didn’t know what to do without him. I miss him.
