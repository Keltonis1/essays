I was debating whether I should go to the inauguration or not. I was excited to see Obama sworn in as our first African American President, but I wanted to see my friend Joe who had been in the hospital for a while. I had been close to Joe since the third grade. I was going to go to the inauguration, but I decided to go see Joe instead. I went to the hospital and saw Joe lying in bed with his neck in a brace. I told him that I was going to the inauguration, and Joe looked at me with his sad eyes. I could tell that he wanted me to stay, but I told him that I was going. I was sad to see Joe in the hospital, but at the same time I was excited for the inauguration and I knew how much it meant to Joe to see the inauguration. I went to the inauguration and thought about Joe during the ceremony. During the speech, Obama said that he was going to be a President for all Americans. I thought about Joe and wished that he could be there for the inauguration. When I got back from the inauguration, I went to the hospital to see Joe. He was sleeping. I woke him up and told him about the inauguration. He said that he was happy for me that I went.
