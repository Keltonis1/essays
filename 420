We were once lost.
But the American Dream came to our rescue.
In the early 1900s, my family emigrated from the East to the West. My grandfather was born in North Korea and lived a life of prosperity in Seoul. He was a famous medical doctor and his family was well-off. But then the Japanese Empire colonized Korea, and his family lost all of their wealth. When the Japanese colonized Korea, they took all of our grandfather’s family’s wealth, so my grandfather had to leave his family and find a new life in the West. When he left Korea, he took nothing but his family’s heirloom—a brass urn that had been passed down from generation to generation. He fled to China and then to America. In America, my grandfather found a job as a janitor in a hospital and worked his way up to become a surgeon.
In the meantime, my grandmother had to stay behind in Korea. It was the late 1930s, and Japan had invaded Korea. Her parents and siblings were forced to live in the North and they never saw each other again. My grandmother was only 13 years old when she was forced to leave her home. She was alone in a new country and she had no one to rely on. When my grandfather came to America, he could not bring his family because the quota was full. In fact, it took him six years to save enough money to send for my grandmother. When she finally came to America, she could not speak a word of English. She was alone, scared, and poor. But America provided my grandmother with the opportunities that she would never have had in Korea. She was given a chance to learn a new language, she was given a chance to start a new life, and she was given a chance to start a family. My parents are a product of the American Dream.
