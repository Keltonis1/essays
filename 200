I took the photograph on my phone, and as I sat on the couch, I smiled. The image was one of those rare times when my mom, my sister, and I were all in the same room. I took it with my phone and saved it to my camera roll. As I was looking through my photos, I noticed something strange. My mom was gone. Instead of seeing my mother standing in front of me, the photograph showed my sister and me. My sister was laughing and looked exactly the same, but I had changed. The photograph was of the two of us, but it looked as if my sister was talking to a mirror. It was as if I was not there. It was as if I had vanished. I didn’t tell anyone. I thought it was just a weird coincidence, but when I got home that night, I looked at the photo again. I was gone. I could still see my sister, but I was not there. I looked at other pictures I had taken and I was not there. I was not in any of them. I didn’t say anything to anyone, but I knew something was wrong. When I got to school the next day, I was scared. I knew that I would be absent, but I was scared of what I would find when I got there. I opened the door to my first class and I saw my teacher. She looked the same as she always did, but she was different. She wasn’t my teacher. I knew it was my teacher, but it was like I was looking at a mirror. It was as if I was looking at myself. I knew something was wrong, but I couldn’t figure it out. I looked at my friends and I was not there. They were laughing and talking and I was not there. I looked at the pictures I had taken of my friends and I was not there. I was not in any of them.
