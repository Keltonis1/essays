I was called to the school counselor’s office. My mother had always taught me to obey adults, so I went without protest. I did not know what to expect, but it was not this. She told me that my father was being deployed to Iraq. I remember feeling a flurry of emotions: confusion and fear, sadness and anger. I was confused because he did not have to go. All he had to do was not enlist in the military. He had not been drafted. He had chosen to be a soldier. Why had he done that to me? Why had he done that to my family? I was angry at him for not thinking about me, my mother, or my little sister. I was afraid because I thought he was going to die. I had many questions for the counselor, but she could not answer my most important question: “Why?” That night, I wrote in my journal about what the counselor had told me. I wrote about how sad I was that he was going to leave me and how angry I was at him for leaving us. I wrote until I no longer had any words. I stopped writing and looked back at the page, hoping that the words would somehow answer my questions. They did not. I looked at the empty white space and a lightbulb went off in my head. I decided to illustrate my journal entry. I took pictures of my family and scanned them into my computer. I drew pictures of the places we had been and the things we had done together. I wrote down memories and illustrated them. It made me feel better. I had not solved my problems, but it helped me to put my feelings into something concrete. The next day in class, we were asked to write about a time when we had a conflict with our parents. I wrote about the day my father was being deployed to Iraq. When I looked up from my computer, I saw the other students reading my journal and laughing.
