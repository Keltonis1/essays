 I know I am not alone. I know there are so many girls like me, girls who are afraid to let their voices be heard, girls who are afraid to be themselves. I am a girl who was born bisexual. That is who I am and I will not apologize for it. My parents, however, do not approve. They believe that I am confused, that I am experimenting. They say that I am too young and do not understand my feelings. They say that bisexuality doesn’t exist. They tell me to forget about boys and focus on school. But how can I not think of boys when I am surrounded by them every day? How can I not focus on school when school is all I have? I want to be myself. I want to be true to myself and the man I am falling in love with. My name is Renee. And I’m bisexual.
