As a young girl in the late 1800s, my great-grandmother, Maria, lived in a small village in the hills of southern Italy. It was a time of cultural and political turmoil that had plagued Italy for hundreds of years. However, the turbulent environment was only a small concern for Maria, for her biggest worry was her family. As a child, Maria was often left to take care of her younger siblings. Her mother was often ill, and her father was a distant, uninvolved figure in her life. In the absence of her parents, Maria's love and compassion for her family grew even deeper. She learned to value family above all else. Her love and dedication to family was so strong that even when Maria moved to America in the late 1920s, she continued to keep in touch with her family back in Italy. Her letters were filled with tenderness and compassion. Though her family was thousands of miles away, she never hesitated to send money to Italy to help her family pay off their debts. After World War II, the Italian economy was in shambles. Food was scarce, and people were desperate. One day, a letter arrived from Italy. Maria's brother informed her that her mother was ill. Maria knew she had to help. Though her husband was reluctant, Maria sold some of her belongings, packed her bags, and took a boat to Italy. When she arrived, Maria found her mother lying in bed. Maria took her hand and held it, caressing it with her thumb. Gradually, her mother's breathing became softer as she fell asleep. She held her mother's hand until she passed away. Maria knew her mother had died, but she did not move. She was there for hours, holding her mother's hand, caressing it, and quietly weeping. Her mother would never wake up again, but Maria's love and compassion for her family had not diminished. She gave everything she had to help her family. She fulfilled her promise
