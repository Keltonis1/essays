I will never forget the day I got my driver’s license. It was like an initiation into adulthood. I could finally escape my parents’ constant supervision. I could explore the outside world without feeling guilty. I could listen to the radio without being told to turn it down. I could drive anywhere, anytime, without being questioned. And I did. I took every opportunity to go somewhere--anywhere. My obsession with driving began to control my life. I spent all my free time either behind the wheel or planning for my next trip. As I drove down the highway, I listened to the same song over and over. I drove to places I’d never been to, sometimes just to look at the view. I would even go to the same place repeatedly, sometimes multiple times a day. I would take the same route, always. The places I drove to and the things I did were all the same. I was always doing the same things, in the same places, with the same people. My life had become repetitive and boring. Then one day, I was going to a store I had been to a million times. I got in the car and started driving. But I couldn’t get the song out of my head. I turned the radio on. The same song was playing. I turned it off. I started thinking about my life. I had become so consumed with driving that I had stopped exploring the world. I had stopped living. My obsession had caused me to lose sight of what really mattered. I had lost control. I got out of the car and started walking. I walked to a park. I saw kids playing, and parents watching them. I saw teenagers kissing in the shade of the trees. I saw people enjoying their lives. And I realized that the world is not about driving. It’s about the people and experiences that make up our lives. And that was the day I learned to drive.
