On May 17, 2008, my mother, Le Thi Ngoc, passed away at the age of 51. She had been diagnosed with lung cancer a year earlier. In a cruel twist of fate, my mother was diagnosed with cancer on her wedding anniversary, May 17, 2007. At first, the doctors did not know the exact cause of the cancer. However, in a startling revelation, they informed us that the cancer was inoperable and was spreading quickly. My mother was given three months to live. We were told that her cancer was caused by a gene mutation that caused her cells to divide at an accelerated rate. She underwent a total of five chemotherapy sessions, which she endured without any complications. After a year, she appeared to be in remission. However, in March 2008, the cancer had reappeared in her bones. It was clear that the cancer had metastasized. She was told that she had only a few months to live. She was only given two options: chemotherapy or hospice care. We chose the latter. In a tragic twist of fate, my mother was informed that she had only three weeks to live. The cancer had spread throughout her body. She had stopped eating, and the cancer had spread to her stomach. She died at home on May 17, 2008.
