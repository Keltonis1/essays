“What’s that?” my mom asked. “It’s an ultrasound,” I answered. “What’s an ultrasound?” “It’s a picture of the baby.” “What’s a baby?” “It’s a little baby that’s growing inside of me.” “What’s growing?” “Mom, it’s a little baby!” “What’s a baby?” I never imagined that I would be pregnant at 16 years old. When I found out I was pregnant, I didn’t know what to do. I was scared and confused. I told my mom I was pregnant and she didn’t believe me. She thought I was just going through a phase. I had to take three pregnancy tests before she believed me. Even then, she was still in denial. She said, “It’s probably just a false positive.” I said, “No, it’s not.” But she wouldn’t believe me. She was angry and she cried. She was really hurt that I didn’t tell her sooner. I couldn’t tell her sooner because I was too scared. I thought she would be disappointed in me and I was scared of being judged. She kept asking me, “Why?” And I couldn’t answer her. I was just scared. She didn’t know what to do either. She didn’t know what to say or do. She was really confused. She didn’t know how to react. My mom was angry at first. She didn’t want me to have the baby. She was scared that I would be hurt and she was scared that she would have to raise another baby.
