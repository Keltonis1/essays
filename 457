I want to tell you my grandmother's story. I want to tell you about a woman who lost her children, saw her grandchildren and great grandchildren go to war, and survived through all this to see a different Korea. I want to tell you about a woman who was a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. But more than anything, I want to tell you about a woman who was a human being, who had a life and had dreams. My grandmother was born in 1929, the same year that the Japanese government annexed Korea. She was born to a farming family in a small coastal town in the Korean province of Jeollanam-do. In 1937, when she was eight years old, my grandmother was forced to work in a factory that produced Japanese military uniforms. Her job, at that young age, was to sew buttons onto the uniforms. I can only imagine the strength and perseverance that she had to have to endure such a horrible situation. When Japan was defeated after World War II, Korea was liberated from the Japanese, but was soon split into two countries: the Republic of Korea in the South, which was supported by the U.S. and U.N., and the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea in the North, which was supported by the Soviet Union. My grandmother and her family lived in the South, which was supported by the U.S. In 1950, three years after the division, the Korean War broke out. My grandmother was forced to flee her home, carrying her baby on her back, as war-planes flew overhead and people screamed. She was separated from her family, and for two years she wandered around the countryside, fighting starvation and disease as she struggled to survive. I can only imagine the fear and confusion that she must have felt during this time. In 1952, she found her way back to her hometown, which had been destroyed during the war. Her house was gone, and in its place was a graveyard
