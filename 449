I am eighteen, and I am scared. I have been accepted to Yale University. I have been accepted to Princeton University. I have been accepted to the University of Chicago. I have been accepted to Stanford University. And I have been accepted to Harvard University. As a young boy, I had always been told that I was going to be someone great. That I would be a lawyer or a doctor, and I would make my parents proud. However, I am terrified. The pressure of college has made me want to give up, and my parents have no idea. They are so proud of me, and they will never know that my future scares me. But I know that I can't give up. I can't give up because I know that I am going to be something great. I know that I am going to be a lawyer or a doctor, and I will make my parents proud.
