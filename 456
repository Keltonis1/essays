The day I was born, my mother held me in her arms and looked at me with pride. She felt happy that she had brought a new life into the world. She said, “Thank you for giving me this wonderful baby.” The hospital staff told her that I was the prettiest baby in the hospital. When I was a little girl, my mother told me that I was the prettiest girl in the world. I loved my mother. I thought she was the prettiest and the kindest woman in the world. I never thought that she would ever die. She was very healthy. When I was five, she got sick. The doctors said she had a disease called breast cancer. I was so sad that I cried every day. I asked my mom if I could have breast cancer too, but she said no. I asked her if I could catch her disease, but she said no. She said that I was too young to get sick. I told her that I didn’t want her to die. She told me that she was going to fight her disease and that I should not worry. I told her that I wanted to fight her disease too. I told her that I wanted to be with her forever. She told me that she loved me and that she would always be with me. She died when I was eight. I am twelve now. I don’t have my mom anymore, but I know that she is still with me. I know that she will always be with me. I will always love my mom.
