My grandmother, my mother, and I were all living in the same house, together, for the first time. After my father died, my mother decided to sell our house in New Jersey and move in with my grandma in Maryland. I had always known my grandma as a “grandma”--you know, the nice old lady who gave you birthday money and homemade presents. But now, I had the chance to see her in a different light. At my grandmother’s house, there was no television, no telephone, and no video games. I had to get outside and play. I spent most of my time with my friends or with my grandmother in her garden. I had to learn to appreciate my time with her. When my friends came over, I would always say, “No, I can’t hang out with you today. I have to go with my grandma.” I was always helping her in her garden, or cooking dinner with her, or just sitting and talking with her. I would help her plant flowers and vegetables. I even learned how to make soup and bread. I also helped her pick out her clothes, take out the trash, and even carry her to the bathroom. She’s a pretty big woman, you know. I even had to help her put on her socks and underwear. My grandmother taught me many things. She taught me how to play the piano, how to dance, and how to play cards. I even learned how to play poker from her. I had to help her do many things, and I think she wanted to teach me how to do them. She was like my mother. I really miss her now. My grandmother died on September 1, 2001. I remember how sad I was. I didn’t know what to do with myself. I felt lost. My grandmother taught me many things. She taught me how to be a better person, how to appreciate life
