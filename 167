My grandparents are old. I mean really old. They’re the oldest people I know. When I’m with them, I feel like a little kid holding their hands. I feel small. I feel naïve. I feel young. They’re old. They’ve lived their whole lives. They’ve seen a lot. They’ve done a lot. They say they’ve been to “the good old days.” I don’t know what that means. I’ve never been to the good old days. But I think it means that back then, they were young and they had fun. They met and fell in love. They got married. They had their kids. They had their grandkids. They’re old. I’m young. But I’m old too. I’ve lived my whole life. I’ve seen a lot. I’ve done a lot. I’m old. I’ve been to “the good old days.” I don’t know what that means. I’ve never been to the good old days. But I think it means that back then, I was young and I had fun. I met and fell in love. I got married. I had my kids. I had my grandkids. I’m old. I’m not the oldest person I know. My grandparents are. That’s why I’m writing this. It’s for them. It’s for my kids and grandkids. It’s for the next generation. Because I want them to know. Because I want them to know what it’s like to be old. I want them to know what it’s like to be young. I want them to know what it’s like to be somewhere
