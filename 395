A normal life was a luxury I had never thought about until it was taken away from me. It was only when I started losing friends that I began to realize how much I took them for granted. Each of my friends had his or her own story and I knew them well. When my best friend, Melissa, was diagnosed with lymphoma, she was determined to beat it and return to her normal life. It was hard to see her in pain and discomfort, but she was always upbeat and cheerful, joking around and smiling. She never complained and she never wanted to give up. She was a true fighter. She endured chemotherapy, radiation, and blood transfusions, but nothing helped. When she died, I was lost. I had never imagined losing her and her death shattered my world. I still feel lost. She was more than just my best friend. She was a sister to me and her death changed my life forever. Melissa had always been the strong one. She had a bright future and she had a smile that could light up a room. Her life was snuffed out in the blink of an eye. When she was gone, I felt like I had nothing left to live for. I lost all interest in school, my friends, and my life. I wanted to die. I began cutting myself, hoping to bleed to death, but I was too scared to do it right. Instead, I just let the blood drip down my arm, hoping that I would just pass out and die. I did not want to live anymore. I was lost and alone. I had always thought of suicide as a permanent solution to a temporary problem. When I realized that my problem was permanent, I knew I had to make a permanent solution. I was too scared to do it myself, so I swallowed a handful of pills and hoped for the best. Luckily, I had only taken some over-the-counter painkillers and I was taken to the hospital before anything happened.
