As I walk along the quiet street, I can feel the light breeze kiss my face. The street is empty, except for a few cars and the occasional passerby. I am alone in this quiet world. Surrounded by my silence, I see a man sitting by the window of a small, deserted room. He is playing the violin. I stop in front of the small building and listen. The beautiful melody flowing from the man’s violin pierces my heart. The song is not happy or sad. Instead, it’s a song that pulls at my heart strings and makes me remember the people who have touched my life. I feel my eyes fill with tears, but I don’t know why. I want to listen to this song forever, but the melody stops abruptly. I turn around and see the man standing on the other side of the street. He smiles at me, nods, and turns around to walk away. I run after the man, but he quickly disappears into the crowd. I can’t find him. Just as quickly as he came, he was gone.
