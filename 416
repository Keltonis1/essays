My grandmother was always my hero. She was the one who raised me and my three siblings when my mother abandoned us. She was the one who sacrificed her own education to provide for us. She was the one who loved me unconditionally and took care of me when I had the flu. But my grandmother was a fighter--a fighter against breast cancer. On May 11, 2003, my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. At first, she did not seem concerned. She had a lot of strength and energy as she went through her first round of chemotherapy. Then, her cancer began to spread. She had more and more trouble walking. She could not do most of the things that she used to do. She had to stop working as a bus driver and was forced to go on disability. She no longer had her strength to fight. She started to get weaker and weaker, and by December 2004, she was confined to a wheelchair. She had to have her teeth removed, and now she had difficulty eating. She had to have a feeding tube put in her stomach, and she had to be fed intravenously. She had to be on oxygen 24 hours a day. She could not even talk anymore. She was wasting away. My grandmother was always so strong that it was hard to see her like this. When she was strong, she could do anything. She could take care of us and work two jobs. But now, she could not even take care of herself. It was so hard seeing this woman who had never been sick before in her life be so helpless. She wanted to live, but she did not want to fight anymore. On January 24, 2005, my grandmother passed away. Before she died, she told me that she wanted to donate her body to science, and that is what she did. She wanted to be a part of something bigger than herself. She wanted to help others. Even though I miss her, I know that she is still with me.
