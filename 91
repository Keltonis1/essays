“Where’s your grandpa?” my friends would ask. “Why don’t you live with him?” They’d always ask me this question, but I never knew how to answer. I was afraid that if I told them the truth, they’d think that my family was weird, and they’d all run away. It was hard enough for me to deal with my grandpa’s condition. He’d always been a lively man who liked to joke around and do funny impressions. But a few years ago, he began to change. He would forget where he put things and would lose his way on familiar routes. He was so frustrated that he would often yell and cry. He also began to lose his temper more easily. My mom told me that he had Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly robs people of their memories. My grandpa was only 55 years old, and it was hard to imagine that he would soon be as old as my mom. I felt sad when I thought of the changes that were happening to him. He’d always been so healthy and full of life. But now, he would be constantly forgetful and tired. He wouldn’t be able to play with me anymore. I knew that my mom was concerned about his condition, but she always seemed to be able to find ways to help him and make him feel better. She always knew what to do. One day, when I was playing with my Legos, I started thinking about how my grandpa used to play with me. I began to think about all the things that he would say to me. “Come on, Grandpa,” I said. “Let’s play.” “Okay,” he said, with a smile. We played together for hours, and I was amazed at how much fun we had.
