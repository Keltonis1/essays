I first saw the tears in my grandmother’s eyes when I was in the fifth grade. As I held my hand to my face, I watched her cry in silence. I asked her what was wrong, but she just shook her head and walked away. I didn’t understand what she was feeling. I didn’t understand her tears. It wasn’t until a few years later that I began to see the tears in my grandmother’s eyes every time she looked at me. They were always there, in the corners of her eyes, threatening to fall at any moment. I didn’t know what to do. My grandmother was always the one who made me feel better when I was sad, who helped me with my homework, who cooked my favorite food. And now, I was the one who was making her cry. The tears in my grandmother’s eyes have never completely fallen. Every time she looks at me, they threaten to fall, but they never do. They are always there, always threatening, always making me feel guilty. And I don’t know what to do. My grandmother always told me that I could be anything I wanted to be. She told me that I could become a doctor, or a lawyer, or a judge, or anything I wanted. But I don’t know if I can do that. I don’t know if I can make her proud. Every time I see her, she looks at me with tears in her eyes, and I feel guilty. I feel like I’m letting her down. But I don’t know how to make her proud. I don’t know how to stop making her cry.
