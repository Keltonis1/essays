When I was 8, I was diagnosed with leukemia. My parents rushed me to the hospital for treatment, and I spent the next four years of my life in and out of hospitals. I was completely isolated, and my only contact with the outside world was through the books my parents brought me. But even then, I was often too sick to focus on my reading. My dad would sit by my bedside and tell me stories, but I never listened to him. I was too busy writing and drawing. I kept my journal with me at all times and wrote down my observations of the hospital, my thoughts, and my feelings. The nurses would huddle by my bedside and look at my scribblings, thinking that I was writing letters to my family or friends. In reality, I was communicating with myself. I could express myself more easily when I wrote or drew than when I spoke. Writing and drawing allowed me to take control of my own life. I could paint a picture of my hospital room, complete with the cracks on the ceiling, the boxes of medicine, and the IV in my arm. I could describe what it felt like to have a needle plunged into my veins, to have blood drawn, to be stuck in bed for months. I started to notice the details of things that I would otherwise have ignored. I could see how the color of the walls changed when the light shone on them. I could see how much the blanket wrinkled when I put my arms under it. I could see how the nurses would walk into the room with a smile on their faces, only to frown when they saw the patient. I could see how the doctorsâ€™ ties would get wrinkled from being in a rush. I could see how much the sick people in the other beds would want to be home with their families. All the things I thought about, the things I saw, I wrote down. And I was the only one who could understand what I wrote.
