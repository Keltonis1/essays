The doctor came into the room and told me the news. “It’s not good.” I couldn’t believe it. I was only 19, and already I was facing a life-threatening disease. “What am I going to do?” I thought to myself. I felt a sense of panic that only a teenager could feel. My first thought was to go to the beach. I wanted to see the ocean. The feeling of the sand on my feet. The salty air on my face. The sound of the waves. I just wanted to get out of the hospital. So I left. The doctors said that I was at risk for an infection, but I didn’t care. I was not going to sit around the hospital and do nothing. I didn’t know what I was going to do, but I knew I was going to do something. When I got to the beach, I saw a group of young boys and girls. They were all laughing and smiling, having a good time. I was jealous. I had just been told that I had a disease that could kill me, and I was stuck in the hospital. I sat down in the sand and started to cry. I looked at the ocean and saw a man struggling to get a small boat back to shore. I couldn’t believe it. He was having the time of his life. I started to think about the things I wanted to do before I died. I had to do something. I went home, and I talked to my family. They told me that I was young and I had my whole life ahead of me. That I should go to school and try to live my life. That I should make something of myself. I told them that I wanted to become a doctor. A doctor who would help people like me. My parents didn’t think that I could do it. They thought I was being stupid.
