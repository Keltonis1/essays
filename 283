The more I look into the heart of a stranger, the more I see my own. On a Sunday afternoon, I found myself sitting in the backseat of a taxi in the mountains of Korea. I was returning from the Buddhist temple where I had taken refuge to escape the heat of the day. But instead of taking the well-trodden path, the driver asked if I wanted to take a shortcut through a narrow and bumpy mountain road. Without any hesitation, I said yes. As we rounded the first corner, the car nearly tumbled off the mountain. The driver quickly corrected the wheel and looked back at me. “Are you okay?” I nodded, and we continued on the path. I sat quietly, pondering the dangers of the road. The driver was a small man with a thin build. His weathered hands were holding onto the wheel as if it were a life raft. He was sweating profusely, and his grip on the wheel was getting tighter. We were only halfway up the mountain, and the heat was almost unbearable. I wanted to reach out to him, but I did not know what to say. Then, I noticed a small trail leading up the mountain. It was a faint dirt path with only a few stones marking its trail. “Can we go this way?” I asked. The driver was relieved. “Oh yes,” he said, “this is much easier.” I was not convinced. The road was narrower than the main path, and the rocks were not as well-placed. However, I did not want to discourage him. “Can you take this path?” I asked. He nodded. The car slowly maneuvered around the hairpin turns. It seemed as though we were riding on top of the mountain rather than on the road. At the same time, I was afraid that we might roll over the edge of the mountain at any moment.
