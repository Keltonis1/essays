I was on my way to school when I heard the news. A plane had hit the Twin Towers. I walked to my first period class with my best friend, and we told our teacher. She told us to go to the school library and turn on the TV. We watched in horror as the second plane hit. I watched the news with my friend and my classmates for the rest of the day. I couldn’t believe what was happening. I went to my AP Government class, and my teacher told us we were going to watch the news in class. We watched for a little while and went back to work. When the bell rang, I headed for my car. My friend and I were talking about what was happening when I heard a massive explosion. I thought it was a car backfiring, but it was another plane hitting the Pentagon. My friend and I watched in shock as the news reporters scrambled to get the latest news. That day, I felt a great sadness. I couldn’t believe what was happening. It was one of the worst days in American history.
