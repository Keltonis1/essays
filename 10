My hands were covered in the slippery, silvery, smooth oil. A smell of something like rubber wafted through the air. I looked at my hands. There was something different about them. I tried to look at my face in the mirror but I could not see it. I touched my face and my hands. My hands felt different. I started to panic. I began to realize that I was wearing a gas mask and that I was in a plastic tent. I started to hyperventilate. I realized that I had been running for a long time and I had no idea how I had gotten there. I heard my name being called over and over. I felt like I was in a movie. I tried to open my eyes but I could not. I tried to speak but I could not. I felt like I was going to die. I thought that I was going to die. I thought about all of the people that I loved. I thought about my family. I thought about my friends. I thought about the fact that I would never get to play my clarinet again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to dance again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to hug my mom again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to hug my dad again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to hug my sister again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to see my grandparents again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to see my cousins again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to see my friends again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to see my teachers again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to see my classmates again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to see my baby sister again. I thought about the fact that I would never get to see my baby brother again.
