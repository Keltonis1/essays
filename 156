I have a really strong memory of my grandmother. She was always really independent and strong-willed, and it was her determination and persistence that allowed her to live for so long. She raised my mother by herself after her husband died in an accident when she was twenty-four years old. She never complained about how hard her life was, and she worked hard to give my mother the best life she could. She never married again, and she worked as a seamstress in a garment factory to support my mother and herself. She had really high expectations for me. I think that’s why I’m the person I am today. When I was little, I had to do really well in school and my grandma always expected me to do my best. My grandma never told me to do my best, but she always expected me to do it. I remember she was always on me about my grades, and she would say, “What’s the matter with you? Why aren’t you doing well in school? You have to do better. You have to do your best.” And I think that’s what really drove me. It was my grandma who instilled in me the drive to always do my best. It’s because of her that I’m always trying to do the best that I can in everything that I do. She also had a really good sense of humor. She loved to laugh and she loved to make people laugh. When I was growing up, she was always telling jokes and laughing. It’s because of her that I’m really funny and really good at making people laugh. She had a really strong sense of family, and she was always really close with my mom. When I was growing up, I remember my mom would always go to my grandma’s house every day, and they would talk and play mahjong. They had a really good relationship
