She was never like the other girls. She was different. Her skin was not as smooth as the other girls, and she never had a boyfriend. Her hair was thick, her nose big, and her lips thick. I liked her because she was funny. She was nice to everyone, even the girls who made fun of her. She always smiled and said hello to me. I was happy to see her every day, and I was happy when I got to sit by her in class. One day she asked me if I would be her boyfriend. I was shocked, and I didn’t know what to say. I just looked at her. She said that she would wait for my answer. The next day I went to school. I saw her waiting for me at the door. I went to her and told her that I would be her boyfriend. She said, “Thank you.” She always waited for me every day after school. One day, I went to the hospital. I saw her. She was lying in a bed. She was sick. I asked the nurse what was wrong with her. She said that she had leukemia. I felt sad and cried. I asked her why she had leukemia. She said that she didn’t know. I wanted to tell her that I loved her, but I didn’t know how to say it. The next day I went to the hospital again. She was lying in the bed. She looked like she was sleeping. I went to her and held her hand. I kissed her. I told her that I loved her. She opened her eyes. I told her that I would always love her. I told her that I would always wait for her. I told her that I would always be her boyfriend. She smiled and closed her eyes. I waited for her every day after school. She never came. I never saw her again.
