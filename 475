I am not sure if the box is even worth saving, but it is the only thing I have left from my childhood.

It was a simple cardboard box that my mother had saved. It was not that old. I think she saved it because it was given to me by my father.

It was the last gift my father gave me.

It was the day I had to leave Korea for the U.S.

The next day I left Korea for the U.S. I do not remember anything else.

It was a box. I remember my father gave it to me on my birthday. I was nine years old.

It was my favorite birthday present.

It was a tiger. I remember that my father
