In August 2007, I was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called multiple myeloma. At the time, I was a fourteen-year-old girl who was getting ready to start high school. My life took a sharp turn when I was told that I had three to five years to live, if I were lucky. My mom and I decided to move across the country and find a doctor who could help me prolong my life. I moved to Seattle with my mom and enrolled in a new high school. That same day, I started treatment. Soon, I had to leave all of my friends behind and just focus on the health of my body. The first year of treatment was the hardest. I was tired and always in pain. I was weak and always in the hospital. I was constantly fighting with my mom, and I was always in tears. I was always at the hospital, and I was always at home. I was always in the hospital with my family, and I was always in the hospital alone. I was always in pain and crying, and I was always in the hospital. I was constantly fighting with my mom, and I was always in the hospital. I was always tired, and I was always in the hospital. I was always crying, and I was always in the hospital. One day, I learned that the treatment was failing. I learned that I was going to die. I was scared and confused. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to feel. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. I was scared and confused. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to feel. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. I didn’t know what to feel. I was scared. I was confused. I was tired. I was in pain. I was always in the hospital.
