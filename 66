When I first met the patient, I was shocked to discover that she was only six years old. The vibrant, blue-eyed child looked no different than any of the other kids in the waiting room, except for the oxygen mask covering her nose and mouth. Her condition had deteriorated so rapidly that the ER doctor was forced to admit her overnight. By the next morning, her condition had worsened even more. Her breathing had become more shallow and her oxygen saturation level had dropped to 80%. I had to ask her to take deep breaths, and I even used my stethoscope to listen to her lungs. Despite my efforts, the child’s oxygen saturation level continued to drop. I asked the nurse to bring in a nebulizer. The nebulizer is a device that generates a fine mist of medicine to treat breathing problems. The child began to breathe better. Then, her oxygen saturation level dropped to 70% and I was concerned that the medicine would not be enough. I was afraid that her condition would worsen even more if I tried to use a higher dose of medicine. I was reluctant to give her any medication that would suppress her breathing, so I decided to try to clear the mucus from her lungs with a bronchoscope. The bronchoscope is a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera attached to the end of it. I inserted the bronchoscope into the child’s mouth and slowly inserted it into her lungs.
