“You’re only going to Korea for a month, right?” My parents asked as I rolled my suitcase down the hall. “You’re going to visit your grandparents, right?” My friends asked as I waited at the airport. “You’re going to learn Korean, right?” My professors asked as I left campus. But my trip to Korea wasn’t a vacation; it was an exchange program. And the program was a study abroad, not a visit. My summer trip to Korea was supposed to be a study in language, culture, and tradition. But it turned into a study in family, humanity, and myself. On my first day of class, my teacher said, “Korean is a language of harmony.” I didn’t quite understand the meaning of her statement at the time, but it didn’t take long for me to realize the significance of her words. From the beginning of the semester, I was surrounded by friends, teachers, and people who went out of their way to help me. They were my classmates, my teachers, my friends, and even my roommates. They became a family to me in a way that no other group of people could have. They taught me about the Korean language and its culture, and they helped me adjust to the differences in our two countries. I have never felt more welcomed in a foreign country. I also realized the extent to which I have taken my own family for granted. The constant support of my friends in Korea, as well as the love of my family at home, made me realize how lucky I am to have such a strong support system. Although I’ve only been in Korea for a month, I feel like I’ve learned so much about my family, my friends, and myself. The food I eat and the places I visit have changed my taste buds and expanded my world
