My grandmother was a strong woman. She had to be. She had to be strong for my mother, her only daughter, when my grandfather died in Korea. She had to be strong for her three sons when she immigrated to the United States, because they were all still young. She had to be strong for her entire family when she moved to the US, because her parents and brothers were left behind. She had to be strong for her husband, my father, when she had to return to Korea to deliver her youngest son. And she had to be strong for her children, because when she moved to America, she had to leave her children behind for years. I remember her as a strong woman. I remember her as the one who taught me to be strong. I remember her as the one who taught me that there is nothing more powerful than the bond between a mother and her child. I remember her as the one who taught me to appreciate the good things in life, like the warm, sunny day in the spring that she took me to the beach. I remember her as the one who taught me that a great education is the key to a successful future. I remember her as the one who taught me that if I work hard, I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I remember her as the one who taught me that the greatest reward in life is to have a family that loves you. I remember her as the one who taught me that there is no greater joy than spending time with your family. I remember her as the one who taught me that there is no greater happiness than a life well lived. I remember her as the one who taught me to be strong. And now I remember her as the one who showed me what strength really is. My grandmother, Young Soon Kim, passed away on June 27, 2005.
