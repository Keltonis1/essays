It is not until I see her walk out of the bathroom that I realize the doctor is the first one to tell me my mother is dying. I try to breathe in, but my throat is too dry to swallow. The smell of bleach fills my nostrils. My mother’s small body is huddled over the edge of the bed. She struggles to stand up, and her left hand finds its way to the cold, metal pole for support. She is so fragile, I want to reach out to her, but the distance between us is too far. It is at that moment that I see the end of my mother. She is not the mother I remember. Her hair, the color of firewood, has been drained of its luster, and the brown color that remained has been drained away by the chemotherapy. Her eyes, once a vibrant blue, have faded to the color of the sky on a cloudy day. She is dying. I want to tell her how much I love her, but the words get caught in my throat. I want to tell her that I will never forget her, but my throat tightens up again. I want to tell her that I will miss her, but I can’t speak. The doctor pats my shoulder and tells me that I should go home to rest. I want to tell her that I will never forget her, but my throat tightens up again. I want to tell her that I will miss her, but I can’t speak. I am afraid. I am afraid of what the world will look like without my mother. I am afraid of being alone. I am afraid of forgetting. My mother walks out of the bathroom. She walks out of my life. I am afraid of what the world will look like without my mother. I am afraid of being alone. I am afraid of forgetting. I am afraid.
