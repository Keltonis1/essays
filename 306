It was a normal day. I was sitting on the couch, watching a morning show, while my mom was brushing her teeth. However, when my mom walked out of the bathroom, I was shocked to see that she had a tennis ball in her mouth. I asked her why she had a tennis ball in her mouth, and she said that it was to strengthen her teeth, and that I should do it too. I was confused. I didn’t understand how putting something in your mouth could strengthen your teeth. I didn’t even know where to put it. I tried to put it in my mouth, but it was a lot harder than I thought it would be. It was uncomfortable, and it hurt. I accidentally bit down on it, and it was even harder to get out. I was scared, because I didn’t know how to get the ball out of my mouth. So I just kept trying to push it out with my tongue. I was so frustrated. I wanted to tell my mom how much this hurt, but I couldn’t because I had the ball in my mouth. Finally, I couldn’t hold it in any longer, and I let the ball out. I was scared that my mom was going to be mad at me, but I was so relieved that I didn’t have to keep it in my mouth. Now, I still don’t understand why you would want to put a tennis ball in your mouth, and I hope I never have to do it again.
