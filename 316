“My goals are to enter the medical profession and many years later become involved in the formation of an international organization in which medical professionals can share their knowledge and experiences.” For most people, this is a common answer to a simple question. However, I am not talking about your average person. With that answer, I am talking about Albert Einstein, the man who laid the groundwork for modern physics. Since I was young, I have always been interested in science and mathematics. In the sixth grade, I decided to take Advanced Placement Physics. I was attracted to the subject because of its abstract nature and the fact that I could actually do something with it. It was not just a bunch of facts to memorize. In fact, the only thing that I did not like about physics was the fact that I could not understand it. It was not until the summer after I took the course that I finally got a grasp of it. I liked physics so much that I decided to take AP Chemistry. Thus, I enrolled in an eight-period science block and an extra class with a teacher who had a passion for chemistry. Then I decided to take the hardest math class at my school, Honors Pre-Calculus. After a year of trying to figure out the material, I finally got it. I liked math so much that I decided to take AP Calculus AB. I tried to take the AP Statistics course, but it conflicted with an already scheduled class. So, I decided to take AP Psychology. After that, I decided to take AP English. And then I took AP Chinese and AP Art History. In my senior year of high school, I decided to take AP World History, AP US History, and AP Chemistry. If I could have taken more AP or Honors courses, I would have. Since I was in middle school, I have been an avid reader of multiple magazines and newspapers. I have always been interested in what is going on in the world
