When I was in fourth grade, I was just another student at Evergreen Elementary. I was proud of my thick, black glasses, my bright red backpack, and my latest math test grade. I was doing well in school, but I was also confused. My teachers would ask me questions that I couldn’t answer. I thought that I was just a slow learner. When I was ten years old, I was diagnosed with autism. Autism is a developmental disability that affects the way I interact with others and process information. Autism makes it difficult for me to speak and understand others. I was a quiet child who would often stay by myself in the classroom. When I did try to make friends, I would get overwhelmed and have a meltdown. My parents enrolled me in a special program for autistic students at Evergreen Elementary. The teachers and the other students were patient and kind to me. I made a lot of progress. The special program gave me the opportunity to learn the same material as my peers in a more structured environment. I loved learning, and I was able to succeed. In the eighth grade, I transferred to a mainstream high school. I still have a lot of trouble communicating, but I’m making friends and taking classes. I’m working hard to improve my communication skills. I’m a member of the school band and the Key Club. I have even joined a club for kids with autism. My friends and teachers are helping me learn how to live and learn independently. Autism has not stopped me from being successful in school. I have dreams of going to college and getting a job. I want to help other kids with autism. I want to show people that people with autism can succeed.
