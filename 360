I am a Geophysicist. My work is about discovering Earth’s fundamental properties. I want to answer questions about the Earth that have never been answered before. What is the layering of the Earth? What is the temperature of the Earth’s core? How old is the Earth? My work requires me to be in places with the most extreme living conditions. I live in a cold metal container and work in a dark hole in the ground. When I began my research, I was not accustomed to extreme cold, so I was worried. I was sure I was going to freeze to death. However, I have lived in the cold container for five years now, and I have not died yet. I am sure that I will die. I know this because eventually, all living things die. But I am not yet ready to die. I want to answer more questions about the Earth. I want to know why the Earth is the way it is. I want to know how the Earth was made. I know that I am going to die, but I am also sure that someone will take my place. Someone who is still alive will become a Geophysicist and answer the questions that I cannot. I am not worried about my job being done by someone else because I know that my research will be important. I want to do my part in the discovery of the Earth. I want to do my part in the exploration of the Earth. I want to do my part in the understanding of the Earth.
