My father used to say that the best way to learn a language is to immerse yourself in the culture. Growing up, I never quite understood what he meant. Sure, I knew that it was important to communicate with others, but it wasn’t until I was exposed to my grandfather’s wisdom that I realized how much more important it is to communicate with yourself. He never had the opportunity to attend a university, and yet his insight into the world was more acute than that of any book. One day, while visiting my grandparents, I stumbled upon my grandfather’s old notebooks. I flipped through the pages, and on the first few I noticed that the handwriting was neat and orderly. As I turned the pages, however, the handwriting became increasingly messy and haphazard. On the last page, I found a poem. It was titled “The Beauty of a Fallen Leaf.” I can’t remember how long it took me to finish reading the poem, but the moment I finished, I felt my heart swell. In my eyes, the poem was not only a work of art, but also a celebration of life. It was as if my grandfather had looked at the world with a pair of eyes that I never knew existed. The poem moved me to tears. I couldn’t believe that my grandfather had written such a beautiful poem. My grandfather was not a famous writer or a literary genius. He was just a simple man. But he was a man who understood the value of every moment of his life. He didn’t just write about life, but he lived life to the fullest. He taught me that it is not enough to just be happy in life. One must express happiness in order to truly live. I will never forget the day I found that poem. I learned from my grandfather that a smile is not a sign of happiness. A smile is happiness.
