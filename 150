 The world is a strange place. It is beautiful and it is ugly. It is compassionate and it is cruel. It is good and it is evil. But above all, it is full of people. People who come together to form a society, a community, a culture, a nation. People who create a place where they can belong. They share their passions and their pain. They share their happiness and their sorrow. They share their beliefs and their convictions. They share their laughter and their tears. They share their hopes and their dreams. They share their love and their hate. They share their joys and their sorrows. For they are people. They are human beings. They are you and me. We are human beings, and we are people.
