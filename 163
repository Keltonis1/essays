When I was a little girl, my family’s first-generation Korean business was struggling to keep up with the changing times. In order to keep the business afloat, my parents had to move us to a small city in the Midwest. That was the first time I had ever been away from California. I started off my first day in school in the wrong classroom. I was scolded and sent to the principal’s office. I was a shy, introverted child. I didn’t know how to make friends or how to speak English, so I became a target for bullies. I felt like an outcast in a new school. I was alone and I was miserable. My parents were too busy to be bothered with me, so I spent the rest of the day wandering around the schoolyard. I found myself in front of the school library. There were so many books in the library! I had never seen so many books in my life. I touched each one and read the titles one by one: “The Trouble with Tuck,” “The Most Beautiful Doll in the World,” “The Secret Garden,” “Anne of Green Gables,” “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”… There were so many other books that I wanted to read. I didn’t recognize most of the words on the pages, but the pictures on the covers all looked so beautiful. I saw the librarian talking to kids who were about my age. I didn’t know what she was saying, but I knew a library was a place where books were plentiful. I wanted to be a part of it, so I approached her with my name and asked if I could be a member of the library. She gave me a blank look and wrote down my name. I tried to ask her about the books, but she didn’t answer. She told me to meet her
