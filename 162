Growing up in Seoul, I often found myself surrounded by people. My house was always filled with family and friends. I remember running around with my cousins in our neighborhood, all of us chasing after one another. Our voices echoed off the surrounding apartment buildings and seeped into the cracks of the sidewalk. As we grew older, we continued to enjoy our time together, often meeting at my house to eat dinner or play video games. However, the people I loved most were my grandparents. I remember spending the most time with my grandmother. She taught me how to play Korean chess, took me to the zoo, and even bought me a bicycle. She would always take care of me and make sure I was happy. But she was not the only one who took care of me. My grandfather always encouraged me to work hard and always provided me with a place to stay when I needed it. As I grew older, my relationship with my grandparents changed. I began to spend less time with them, as I was always with my friends. But I always made sure to call them when I was feeling lonely. My grandfather always told me that if I ever had a problem, I could come over and he would help me solve it. This became true when I needed to write my college essay. My grandfather gave me the idea to write about my relationship with my grandparents. He was always the one to cheer me up when I was down, and he encouraged me to go to college and find a job that I enjoyed. After my grandfather died, I had trouble writing my essay. But I knew I wanted to write about him. I knew that he was the one who encouraged me to go to college and who made me want to be successful. I realized that I needed to write about him because he was the one who was always there for me. I needed to remember him because he had been there for me through the best and worst times of my life. So I wrote about him.
