I was only seven when my grandfather first took me to the library, but I already knew that it was a special place. He told me that it was where people went to find books, but also to share their experiences and the knowledge they held inside. He showed me how to find books on the shelves, how to check them out, and how to return them. I learned that there was a whole world of knowledge in those books that I could not find anywhere else. I learned that there was a place that people could go to learn new things. There was a place that people could go to know more about the world around them and the people in it. My grandfather always told me that there was nothing I should fear in the library, and he showed me that there was nothing to be afraid of. When my grandfather died, I was only nine years old. He was the most important person in my life, and I was devastated. I no longer wanted to go to the library. I felt that it was a place that would take away the memories of my grandfather. I did not want to learn new things; I just wanted to remember the things I already knew. I wanted to keep the memories of my grandfather alive. But he had always told me that there was nothing to fear, and I knew that I had to prove that I was not afraid. I was not afraid of the library, and I was not afraid of learning new things. I knew that I should go to the library, but I was afraid of what I would see there. It felt as if the library would come alive with the memories of my grandfather. I felt that they would be everywhere, waiting for me. I knew that I would see his face everywhere I looked. I knew that I would see him when I looked at the people in the library. I knew that he was in the books. I knew that he was everywhere. I was so afraid. I did not want to see him
