When my grandmother was first diagnosed with cancer, I was just a child. I had heard my parents whispering about her “condition,” but I had no idea what cancer was. I knew it was a sickness, and I knew it was bad, but I didn’t know how it worked. My grandmother’s sickness was the reason I started to pay attention in health class. As I learned about cancer and the various ways it can spread, I was intrigued. I wanted to know everything about it. It seemed as if cancer was like a puzzle, and I wanted to find the answer. I knew that if I could understand how cancer worked, I could understand how to stop it. So, when I was in eighth grade, I decided to do a science fair project on cancer. I decided to focus on breast cancer because my grandmother had been diagnosed with it. I learned about the biology of cancer cells, the difference between tumor and non-tumor cells, and the causes of cancer. My hypothesis was that cancer cells are able to invade healthy tissue and metastasize to distant parts of the body because of the production of an enzyme called telomerase. If I could stop the production of telomerase in cancer cells, I thought, I could prevent them from spreading. I tested my hypothesis by treating the cancer cells with two different chemicals, one that would prevent telomerase production and another that would block the cell’s ability to produce proteins. Both chemicals significantly slowed the growth of the cancer cells, which confirmed my hypothesis. I was able to use my findings to form a potential treatment for breast cancer. Although my grandmother has passed away, my work has helped me cope with her death. I was able to honor her memory by learning more about cancer and doing something that could potentially help others. I know she would be proud of me.
