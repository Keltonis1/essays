My grandma was the only person who knew about my parents' divorce. My parents fought a lot, but it was just another family problem. I was young and never thought about what was going on. My grandma was a different story. She would come to our house and ask my mom what was going on. My mom would tell her that everything was fine. But one day, my grandma told my mom that she knew what was going on and that she should try to make my dad happy. I was happy that my grandma knew, but I didn't know how to tell her that my parents were getting a divorce. So I just told her that everything was fine. I had a feeling that she knew that my parents were getting a divorce, but she never brought it up again. My grandma was sick for a long time. My mom would always tell me that she was getting better, but I knew that she wasn't. My mom and I went to visit my grandma one day and she was so weak that she could barely talk. I was scared that she was going to die, but my mom kept telling me that she was getting better. My grandma's breathing was getting harder and harder. She had to use oxygen to help her breathe. I was so scared that she was going to die. She started getting better after that, but she had a stroke that left her paralyzed on the right side of her body. It took her a long time to recover, but she was able to walk again. She went to physical therapy and she was able to walk with a walker. When she got home, I would always help her with her walker. She was able to walk by herself and she would do exercises at home. She was doing better and I was happy. I didn't know that she had cancer. I thought that she was just getting old. My mom told me that she had cancer and that she was going to die. I didn't want to believe it
