The smell of onions sizzling in a pan. The soft texture of meat when I bit into it. The crunchy texture of vegetables. The food was always delicious, but I never thought much of it. Food was just food to me, a necessary part of life. My family and I ate together every day. We would talk and laugh as we shared a meal. It was an integral part of our family life. One day, my mother came home from work, her face pale and a slight sheen of sweat on her forehead. She collapsed on the couch and I rushed to her side. I held her head and felt her forehead. She had a fever. “Mom, are you okay?” I asked. She just shook her head. I called the doctor, and she prescribed medicine. My mom took the medicine and seemed to get better. She said she felt tired and needed to rest. I went to school and told my friends about my mom. They said they were sorry to hear that. I went home and cooked dinner for my family. My mom came home late and said she felt much better. She was a little dizzy, but that was normal after getting medicine. We ate dinner together and talked about our day. I told her about my friend that was in the hospital. She said she felt tired and needed to rest. She took her medicine and went to bed. I was sad that my mom had to take medicine, but I was happy that she was feeling better. The next day, my mom was not feeling well again. She took her medicine and went to bed. I asked her if she wanted to go to the doctor again, but she said it was unnecessary. She just needed to rest. The next day, she was not feeling well again. She went to bed and said she needed to rest. The next day, she was not feeling well again. She went to bed and said she needed to rest
