I don’t remember my grandmother’s face. I don’t remember the sound of her voice. I don’t remember her touch. I don’t remember her smile. That’s because my grandmother died when I was only two years old. So I never had a memory of her living to remember her when she died. But this doesn’t mean that I don’t remember her. My mother tells me that my grandmother was a kind and loving woman. I’ve heard many stories about her. I’ve heard stories about how she would always protect her children. How she would always be there for her children. How she would always be there for her family. How she would always be there for her husband. My mom tells me that my grandmother was a very hard-working and kind woman. She would work hard to make sure that her family was able to survive. She was always thinking of her family and how to make them happy. Although I never had the chance to meet her, I know that she is a part of me. She is a part of me because she gave me life. She gave me life because she was my grandmother. She will always be a part of me because she gave me life.
