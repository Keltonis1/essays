"I'm doing this for my future," I thought as I got on the bus. "I'm doing this for my future," I thought as I walked out of the bus. "I'm doing this for my future," I thought as I approached the building I was going to be in for the next four years. "I'm doing this for my future," I thought as I walked into my room. "I'm doing this for my future," I thought as I unpacked my things. "I'm doing this for my future," I thought as I walked to the dining hall. I thought about my future every time I had to take a shower, go to class, or eat. I thought about my future when I was so tired I could sleep for days or when I was so hungry I could eat for days. I thought about my future every time I got on the bus or walked back to my room. I thought about my future every time I got a message from one of my friends asking how I was doing. I thought about my future every time I got a message from one of my friends asking if I was okay. I thought about my future every time I got a message from one of my friends telling me how much they missed me. I thought about my future every time I thought of my friends. Every time I thought of my friends, I thought of my future. I thought about my future every time I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket. I thought about my future every time I turned my phone over and saw that it was a text. I thought about my future every time I saw that it was from my mom. I thought about my future every time I saw that it was from my dad. I thought about my future every time I saw that it was from my brother. I thought about my future every time I saw that it was from my sister. I thought about my future every time I saw that it was from my grandparents
