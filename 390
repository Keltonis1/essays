I stand on a narrow cliff. Behind me, the sunset casts a shadow on the turbulent sea below. The gentle waves caress the shore, whispering an invitation to forget about my past. The fiery sky is a beautiful background for the purple and yellow blossoms of the nearby island. However, I know the sea will drag me back into the sorrow I have tried to escape. This is the place where my love was buried. I come here every day. I stand on this cliff, the only witness to the sunset. And when the darkness of the night sets in, I go down to the beach, listen to the whispers of the waves, and gaze at the sky. I come here to talk to her. I donâ€™t know how long I have been here, or how many times I have come. The sun has set and the moon is out. I have a lot to tell her. I have not come to say goodbye. It is not the time to let go. I come to tell her I still remember her smile, her voice, and her love. I tell her about the flowers blooming on the island and the waves dancing in the sky. I tell her I am still here. I tell her I love her. I am still here.
