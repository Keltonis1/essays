A familiar face, an unfamiliar situation, an urgent need to get to class, a series of mechanical movements, a rush of anxiety, a few minutes lost, and then another familiar face, yet again an unfamiliar situation, and another need to get to class. A few billion of these faces and situations are connected by a similar sense of urgency each and every day. I am a college student, and I feel as if I am one of them.
