My grandmother is in her early sixties, but she has lived through more than a century. In her youth, she was a soldier during the Korean War, an experience she does not like to talk about. She worked as a math teacher and is a master at traditional Korean embroidery. She has been a Buddhist for over thirty years, practicing Zen meditation. She also enjoys reading literature and philosophy, especially Goethe, Nietzsche, and Dostoyevsky. Although she has had cancer for many years, she has a positive outlook on life and a strong spirit. She has always been a source of wisdom and inspiration for me. In my opinion, the greatest quality of a person is being able to live in harmony with oneself. A life of chaos and struggle is meaningless. My grandmother is a living example of how a person can live in harmony with oneself. She has never been in debt, and is always content with her life. When I ask her why she never spends money, she says that she has enough. The only extravagance she allows herself is a cup of coffee every day. I respect my grandmother very much. I want to be like her when I grow up.
