I’ve had to live with the constant feeling of guilt and disappointment. I was the eldest daughter of three, and the only girl in a household of three brothers. When I was little, my parents always told me that I was the “baby” of the family. Even though I wasn’t the youngest, I always felt like I was. My brothers always had more freedom than me. I was often left at home to take care of my younger siblings, and was never able to join in the fun. While my brothers were free to roam the neighborhood, I was left at home to play with my dolls. When my parents weren’t around, my brothers would tease me. When my parents were around, they were nice to me, but it was as if they didn’t know me. I always felt like I was a stranger in my own family. I felt like I had to compete for my parents’ attention, and my brothers never let me forget that I was the baby. They always picked on me, and I was always trying to prove that I was as good as them. I was a constant source of entertainment for my brothers. When I was younger, I would try to make myself look as unattractive as possible. I thought that if I didn’t look pretty, my brothers would stop teasing me. When I was about seven years old, I found out that my parents had arranged for me to be married to a boy who lived about an hour away from us. I was shocked and terrified. I was going to be shipped off to live with strangers. I didn’t want to leave my parents, my home, or my brothers. My parents didn’t tell me much about my future husband. I was told that he was very handsome and intelligent, and that he was also very kind and had a great personality. They made him sound perfect, and I was a little jealous.
