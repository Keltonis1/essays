My senior year of high school started out just like all the other years. I was looking forward to graduating and going to college. I had a few friends, my grades were good, and I was an active member of our school’s theater program. I started to look for colleges at the beginning of my senior year, but I didn’t get very far. I had been accepted to some good schools, but I couldn’t afford the tuition. I was living at home and going to a private high school, so I had spent most of the money my parents had saved for college. We had planned on going to one of the nicer state schools, but they didn’t have money for me. I was really disappointed, but my parents told me that I could just go to community college for two years, then transfer to a four-year school. My mom was working two jobs at this point, and my dad was working as a security guard. I started to see my friends going off to school, and my mom constantly telling me that I had a lot of time. I didn’t understand why she thought I had so much time, but I was afraid to tell her that I wanted to go to a four-year school. I didn’t want to disappoint her, so I just went with the community college plan. My mom started getting sick a lot. She would get headaches and have to go to the doctor. She started missing days of work because she would get sick, then get better, then get sick again. She started getting sick more and more often. She would lose track of things, forget what she was doing, and lose her keys. Her boss noticed that she was losing focus and decided to let her go. My mom was upset, but she told me not to worry about it and that she would find a new job. I was worried that she wouldn’t be able to find another job
