I walked up to the elderly woman sitting on the park bench. She had been watching the children in the playground for over an hour, but she didn’t seem to notice me. As I drew closer, I could see the tiredness in her eyes, and a slight sheen of sweat on her wrinkled brow. I asked her if she would like to come into the air-conditioned coffee shop across the street. “Oh no, thank you,” she said, “I’m fine right here.” I looked down at the magazine she was holding. The cover had a photo of a smiling family on a sailboat, and the title, “The Joy of Grandparenting.” “That’s a great magazine,” I said. “You should read it.” “Oh no, I’m not reading it. I’m waiting for my grandchildren.” “Really?” I said. “How many do you have?” “Seven,” she replied. “I’ve been waiting for them to come since noon. I’m so tired. I’ve been standing here the whole time.” “Oh, well,” I said, “it looks like they’re coming now.” The old woman turned around, and I saw a beautiful family approaching. The grandmother smiled and held out her arms. The grandchildren ran to her, and they all hugged each other. “Grandma,” one of the kids said, “we’re here!” “Yes,” she replied, “I’m so glad to see you!” I could tell that the children loved their grandmother. They played with her and talked with her, and they didn’t want to leave.
