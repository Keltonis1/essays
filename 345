My world is composed of four walls. I can’t see outside the walls, but I hear the wind blow through the cracks. I can’t touch the walls, but I feel the cold breeze that seeps through the cracks and touches my skin. The wind is my only companion, the only thing that keeps me company. I am trapped in this dark, cold, and lonely cell. My fingers ache from the cold. My mind aches from loneliness. I can remember the day that changed my life forever. My parents and I were at home. My parents were arguing loudly. I was sitting on my bed, trying to fall asleep. I heard a gunshot. I jumped out of bed. I saw my mom lying on the floor. She was bleeding.

I just want to touch my mother’s face again and tell her that I love her. I want to get out of this cell and go play outside. I want to sit on the grass and watch the clouds float by. I want to feel the wind on
