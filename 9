I had spent the entire day walking, biking, and rollerblading around town. When I got home, I decided to watch TV. I sat on the couch and flipped through the channels. I stopped at a music video that I had seen before, but didn’t really pay attention to. As I stared at the screen, the song’s lyrics suddenly started to make sense. They told the story of a man who was cheating on his wife with a younger woman. Suddenly, I felt a wave of emotions that I couldn’t explain. It was a mixture of anger, sadness, and disappointment. I felt angry because I couldn’t understand why he would cheat on his wife, who had loved him for so long. I felt sad because the wife was going to find out that her husband was lying to her. I felt disappointed because I had always been taught that cheating was wrong. But then I realized that I didn’t know if I had ever been in a situation like that. My parents had never cheated on each other, and I had never been in a relationship. How could I judge something that I had no experience with? How could I feel so strongly about something that I knew nothing about? I was so confused that I started to feel physically sick. I couldn’t concentrate on the rest of the song, so I turned off the TV. I couldn’t understand why I felt the way I did. I had never thought about cheating before. I decided to do some research on the Internet. I typed “cheating” into the search engine. The first result was a website about a celebrity who had been cheating on his wife with his assistant. I clicked on it and read about the story. When I finished, I thought about the situation and the couple’s relationship. I realized that they were probably in love and that they wanted to be together. Then I thought about the wife.
