My mother is always telling me that I’m too shy. She says that I’m afraid of making friends and that I never look people in the eye. I think she’s wrong. I don’t think I’m shy at all. I think I’m just selective. When I look at someone, I don’t see just a person, I see the way that they’re made up of a whole bunch of parts. I see the different muscles that are working to keep them standing up, and the different bones that are holding them together. I see the way that the bones are connected to the muscles, and the way that the muscles are connected to the bones. I see all the different colors and all the different shades of those colors. I see all the different ways that they smell, and all the different things that they taste like. I see the way that they move and the way that they sound when they talk. I see all of that, but I don’t just see it all at once. I see it all individually. I’m not just looking at the whole person, I’m looking at the parts of the person. I think that makes me more interesting than other people. I think that makes me special.
