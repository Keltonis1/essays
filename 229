I was excited to learn that my class would be visiting the University of Michiganâ€™s VA Hospital. Though I had never visited a hospital, I was curious about the patients and their lives. I imagined that the patients were all old and in pain, but when I arrived, I learned that this was not the case. The patients ranged in age from early 20s to the elderly, all of whom were there for different diseases. As I walked through the hospital, I was surprised to learn that the VA Hospital is much like any other hospital. The hospital was bustling with doctors, nurses, and patients, and the hospital itself smelled of fresh paint and disinfectant. Not only was the hospital different from my expectations, but also the patients. I found the patients to be pleasant and cheerful. In the cancer center, I was surprised to find that the patients were almost always laughing and joking with their friends, doctors, and nurses. They were not in pain; they were not even thinking about their disease. Frankly, they were in better spirits than I would be in their situation. In the same room as the cancer patients, I saw a man with an amputated leg. His prosthetic leg was covered in a black sock and he was smiling. I saw a man with a wheelchair and a man with an oxygen tank. I saw the patients walking with walkers and crutches. Even though I expected to see sick people, I saw only happy people. One patient told us his story. He went to Iraq and was injured in an explosion. He was in the burn center for a long time, but now he was cancer-free and a cheerful, happy person. This experience taught me that I should be thankful for my life and that I should not complain about the small problems in my life. When I got home that day, I sat down and wrote a letter to the class telling them about my experience.
